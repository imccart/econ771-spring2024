Instead of requiring that parallel trends holds exactly, we impose restrictions on how diﬀerent the post-treatment violations of parallel trends can be from the pre-treatment diﬀerences in trends (“pre-trends”). The causal parameter of interest is partially identiﬁed under these restrictions. We introduce two approaches that guarantee uniformly valid inference under the imposed restrictions, and we derive novel results showing that they have desirable power properties in our context. We illustrate how economic knowledge can inform the restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends in two economic applications. We also highlight how our approach can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses showing what causal conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the possible violations of the parallel trends assumption.},

	abstract = {We state a sufficient condition under which choice data alone suffices to identify consumer preferences when choices are not fully informed. Suppose that: (i) the data generating process is a search model in which the attribute hidden to consumers is observed by the econometrician; (ii) if a consumer searches good j, she also searches goods which are better than j in terms of the non-hidden component of utility; and (iii) consumers choose the good that maximizes overall utility among searched goods. Canonical models will be biased: the value of the hidden attribute will be understated because consumers will be unresponsive to variation in the attribute for goods that they do not search. Under the conditions above and additional mild restrictions, an alternative method of recovering preferences using cross derivatives of choice probabilities succeeds regardless of the search protocol and is thus robust to whether consumers are informed. The approach nests several standard models, including full information. Our methods suggest natural tests for full information and can be used to forecast how consumers will respond to additional information. We verify in a lab experiment that our approach succeeds in recovering preferences when consumers engage in costly search.},

	abstract = {In this chapter we outline the tools that have been developed to model and analyze competition and regulation in health care markets, and describe particular papers that apply them to policy-relevant questions. We focus particularly on the I.O. models and empirical methods and analyses that researchers have formulated to address policy-relevant questions, although we also provide an overview of the institutional facts and findings that inform them. We divide the chapter into two broad sections: (i) papers considering competition and price-setting among insurers and providers and (ii) papers focused specifically on insurance and market design. The former set of papers is largely concerned with models of oligopolistic competition; it is often focused on the U.S. commercial insurance market where prices are market-determined rather than being set administratively. The latter focuses on insurance market design with an emphasis on issues raised by asymmetric information, leading to adverse selection and moral hazard. In addition, we discuss the literature on consumer choice frictions in this market and the significant implications of those frictions for I.O. questions.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal—thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

	abstract = {This paper studies how the growth and evolution of product assortments impact consumer adoption, churn, and long run consumption. Most economic theories of product variety and the value of platforms suggest consumers at least weakly prefer larger product assortments. In contrast, the psychological literature on the phenomenon of choice overload finds that larger assortments overwhelm consumers with decision costs or induce more regret. I provide empirical evidence of how the size and contents of product assortments impact consumers over their lifetime in an online platform market that provides restaurant delivery. I find that assortment expansion increases the acquisition of new consumers but reduces the frequency of consumption among consumers who remain on the platform. I rationalize these impacts via a model of costly attention and choice under limited information. Counterfactual exercises show that targeting choice set reductions can improve revenue among existing customers.},

	abstract = {We examine the impacts of physician-hospital integration on care fragmentation and other measures of care-coordination using a dynamic model of movers and stayers in commercially insured plans. Although recent growth in the share of practicing physicians belonging to these vertical organizations has sparked considerable policy debate, there is a paucity of evidence on the merits of vertical integration in the private segment of the market. We fill the gap by focusing on care-coordination in the relatively open plans that dominate commercial insurance, namely Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). We exploit the fact that physician-hospital integration levels vary dramatically across MSA and focus on orthogonal employment-based transfers for identification. We track 415,000 beneficiaries with 17 million claims between 2010 and 2016. We find that standard two-way fixed effect mover-stayer models produce biased estimates since there are heterogeneous effects of integration. Extending the dynamic event study design of Sun and Abraham (2021) to mover-stayer analyses, we are able to avoid these biases. We find that a move from the 10th to 90th percentile of physician integration level causes a 20\% relative decrease in a care fragmentation index; similar declines are found in independent markers of fragmentation such as use of out-of-network and single-service facilities. Vertical integration of either primary care physicians or specialists reduced fragmentation significantly. However, only vertical integration of specialists led to significant reductions in medical spending. Our results are robust when adjusting for moves associated with alternative contractual arrangements among providers that do not require outright ownership.},

	abstract = {Modern empirical work in regression discontinuity (RD) designs often employs local polynomial estimation and inference with a mean square error (MSE) optimal bandwidth choice. This bandwidth yields an MSE-optimal RD treatment effect estimator, but is by construction invalid for inference. Robust bias-corrected (RBC) inference methods are valid when using the MSE-optimal bandwidth, but we show that they yield suboptimal conﬁdence intervals in terms of coverage error. We establish valid coverage error expansions for RBC conﬁdence interval estimators and use these results to propose new inference-optimal bandwidth choices for forming these intervals. We ﬁnd that the standard MSE-optimal bandwidth for the RD point estimator is too large when the goal is to construct RBC conﬁdence intervals with the smaller coverage error rate. We further optimize the constant terms behind the coverage error to derive new optimal choices for the auxiliary bandwidth required for RBC inference. Our expansions also establish that RBC inference yields higher-order reﬁnements (relative to traditional undersmoothing) in the context of RD designs. Our main results cover sharp and sharp kink RD designs under conditional heteroskedasticity, and we discuss extensions to fuzzy and other RD designs, clustered sampling, and pre-intervention covariates adjustments. The theoretical ﬁndings are illustrated with a Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical application, and the main methodological results are available in R and Stata packages.},

I find complementarities in adoption through a reducedform analysis with instruments for unobserved market characteristics. I further develop a dynamic oligopoly model to allow for strategic timing incentives that are missing in the static model. Adopting a dominant local vendor could increase perperiod profits from adoption by 9.2\% over choosing a marginal vendor. A counterfactual analysis suggests an incentive program rewarding coordination, not just adoption, is more effective in achieving interoperability, especially before the widespread adoption of the technology.},

Confidence interval undercoverage exceeds 5\% only for endogeneity beyond that seen even when IV and OLS estimates differ by an order of magnitude. Three widely-cited applications are used to explain why endogeneity is likely low enough for IV estimates to be reliable. IV identification typically implies a first-stage sign restriction; most analysts probably screen their estimates accordingly. We show that screening on the estimated first stage sign halves median bias of conventional IV without reducing coverage.},

	abstract = {We revisit the classic semi‐parametric problem of inference on a low‐dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high‐dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high‐dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high‐dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N−1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman‐orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross‐fitting, which provides an efficient form of data‐splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N−1/2‐neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.},

One common approach is to emphasize a credible research design; we review results from two randomized experiments, as well as some quasi-experimental studies. This work has produced compelling evidence that moral hazard in health insurance exists—that is, individuals, on average, consume less healthcare when they are required to pay more for it out of pocket—as well as qualitative evidence about its nature. These studies alone, however, provide little guidance for forecasting healthcare spending under contracts not directly observed in the data. Therefore, a second and complementary approach is to develop an economic model that can be used out of sample. We note that modeling choices can be consequential: different economic models may fit the reduced form but deliver different counterfactual predictions. An additional role of the more descriptive analyses is therefore to provide guidance regarding model choice.},

We develop a framework that combines data on health outcomes and insurance plan choices for a population of insured individuals with a model of a competitive insurance exchange to predict outcomes under different exchange designs. We apply this framework to examine the effects of regulations that govern insurers' ability to use health status information in pricing. We investigate the welfare implications of these regulations with an emphasis on two potential sources of inefficiency: (i) adverse selection and (ii) premium reclassification risk. We find substantial adverse selection leading to full unraveling of our simulated exchange, even when age can be priced. While the welfare cost of adverse selection is substantial when health status cannot be priced, that of reclassification risk is five times larger when insurers can price based on some health status information. We investigate several extensions including (i) contract design regulation, (ii) self-insurance through saving and borrowing, and (iii) insurer risk adjustment transfers.},

Data analysis was conducted from July 2019 to December 2021.The primary exposure was tier of CH status, defined using self-reported pediatric services, affiliation with pediatric focused programs, and validated based on proportion of pediatric admissions.Payments for common surgical procedures from private insurers and overall complication and readmission rates at 30, 60, and 90 days.There were 368 220 pediatric patients who underwent one of the surgical procedures of interest; 220 899 (60.0\%) of the patients were male; 118 977 (32.3\%) had their procedure at freestanding CH (CH-A), 75 256 (20.4\%) at CH attached to an adult hospital (CH-B), and 173 987 (47.3\%) at NCH. The mean (SD) payment for all procedures at CH-A was \$6533.56 (\$6399.97), \$5847.50 (\$4947.47) at CH-B, and \$5034.25 (\$4787.07) at NCH. The mean (SD) overall complication rate was 0.004 (0.06) at CH-A, 0.01 (0.07) at CH-B, and 0.003 (0.06) at NCH. Readmission rates at 30, 60, and 90 days were similar across all hospital types. After adjusting for zip code, year, surgery, surgery setting, and observable patient, hospital, and county characteristics, the estimated payments for inpatient common procedures were 39\% higher at CH-A than at NCH. Payments for outpatient common procedures were 34\% higher at CH-A than at NCH.In this cohort study, children who underwent common surgical procedures had equivalent clinical outcomes at CH and NCH but the procedures were associated with higher payments and, thus, overall lower value care. To ensure delivery of optimal value to patients and payers, more research is needed to evaluate mechanisms to ensure access, decrease costs, and improve value at both CH and NCH.},

Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) provide a flexible random coefficients logit model which accounts for the endogeneity of prices. This article reviews and combines several recent advances related to the estimation of BLP-type problems and implements an extensible generic interface via the PyBLP package. Monte Carlo experiments and replications suggest different conclusions than the prior literature: multiple local optima appear to be rare in well-identified problems; good performance is possible even in small samples, particularly when “optimal instruments” are employed along with supply-side restrictions. If Python is installed on your computer, PyBLP can be installed with the following command: pip install pyblp.Up-to-date documentation for the package is available at https://pyblp.readthedocs.io.},

We show that, in this model, there is no basis for the presumption that vertical integration increases equally weighted social surplus, while it is possible that horizontal mergers that appropriately change bargaining weights increase social surplus. Moreover, efficient bargaining implies that in equilibrium noncontractible investments are efficient.},

Within the class of signal structures that induce pure-strategy pricing equilibria, we derive signal structures that are optimal for firms and those that are optimal for consumers. The firm-optimal policy amplifies underlying product differentiation, thereby relaxing competition, while ensuring consumers purchase their preferred product, thereby maximizing total welfare. The consumer-optimal policy dampens differentiation, which intensifies competition, but induces some consumers to buy their less preferred product. Our analysis sheds light on the limits to competition when the information possessed by consumers can be designed flexibly.},

Exploiting pseudorandom variation in emergency admissions, I find that a one-standard-deviation admission shock increases the unplanned readmission rate by 4.1 percent. Nonparametric and heterogeneity analyses suggest that "quicker and sicker" discharges contribute to the additional readmissions. The crowding impacts are larger in hospital departments with fewer beds, sicker patients, and stronger incentives to admit nonemergency patients.},

This paper tests whether consumers use HSAs as self-insurance over the life cycle. Using administrative data from a large employer and a regression discontinuity design, I estimate the marginal propensity to consume from HSA assets is 0.85 and reject the neoclassical benchmark of 0. Comparisons with 401(k) saving show most employees do not treat HSA money as fungible with retirement savings. In this setting, HSAs did not reduce health spending and instead increased the share that was financed tax-free.},

Our findings suggest that liability risk can percolate throughout a vertical chain and may have a significant chilling effect on downstream innovation.},

However, insurance may also transfer resources from high-liquidity periods to low-liquidity periods. We test for this type of transfer from health insurance by studying the distribution of Social Security checks among Medicare recipients. When Social Security checks are distributed, prescription fills increase by 6–12 percent among recipients who pay small copayments. We find no such pattern among recipients who face no copayments. The results demonstrate that more complete insurance allows recipients to consume healthcare when they need it rather than only when they have cash.},

We also argue that current threshold levels likely are too lax, unless one expects efficiency gains of 5 percent or greater, or other factors such as entry and product repositioning to significantly constrain the exercise of market power postmerger.},

	abstract = {Individual outcomes are highly correlated with group average outcomes, a fact often interpreted as a causal peer effect. Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is defined as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intraclass correlation coefficient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially significant causal effects.},

It is found that inference is not possible unless the researcher has prior information specifying the composition of reference groups. If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes. Inference is difficult to impossible if these variables are functionally dependent or are statistically independent. The prospects are better if the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes are moderately related in the population.},

An important recurring theme is that the causal identification of peer effects depends on the structure of the network itself. In the absence of correlated effects, the reflection problem is generally solved by network interactions even in non-linear, heterogeneous models. By contrast, microfoundations are generally not identified. We discuss and assess the various approaches developed by economists to account for correlated effects and network endogeneity in particular. We classify these approaches in four broad categories: random peers, random shocks, structural endogeneity and panel data. We review an emerging literature relaxing the assumption that the network is perfectly known. Throughout, we provide a critical reading of the existing literature and identify important gaps and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Health insurers increasingly compete on their networks of medical providers. Using data from Massachusetts’s insurance exchange, I find substantial adverse selection against plans covering the most prestigious and expensive “star” hospitals. I highlight a theoretically distinct selection channel: consumers loyal to star hospitals incur high spending, conditional on their medical state, because they use these hospitals’ expensive care. This implies heterogeneity in consumers’ incremental costs of gaining access to star hospitals, posing a challenge for standard selection policies. Along with selection on unobserved sickness, I find this creates strong incentives to exclude star hospitals, even with risk adjustment in place. (JEL D82, G22, H75, I11, I13, I18)},

	abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size—"high-dimensional data"—are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in "data mining" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term "data mining" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for "true" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},

We decompose real total annual compensation per worker into components related to observable employee characteristics, personal heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity, and residual variation. Except for the residual, all components may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. At the level of the individual, we find that person effects, especially those not related to observables like education, are a very important source of wage variation in France. Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive and more profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are not more high-skilled labor intensive. We find that person effects explain about 90\% of inter-industry wage differentials and about 75\% of the firm-size wage effect while firm effects explain relatively little of either differential.},

In practice, choosing an insurance plan is a complicated decision often made without full information. In this paper we combine new administrative data on health plan choices and claims with unique survey data on consumer information to identify risk preferences, information frictions, and hassle costs. Our additional friction measures are important predictors of choices and meaningfully impact risk preference estimates. We study the implications of counterfactual insurance allocations to illustrate the importance of distinguishing between these micro-foundations for welfare analysis. (JEL D81, D8 3, G22, I13)},

	abstract = {Insurance benefit design has important implications for consumer welfare. In this article, we model insurer behaviour in the Medicare prescription drug coverage market and show that strategic private insurer incentives impose a fiscal externality on the traditional Medicare program. We document that plans covering medical expenses have more generous drug coverage than plans that are only responsible for prescription drug spending, which translates into higher drug utilization by enrolees. The effect is driven by drugs that reduce medical expenditure and treat chronic conditions. Our equilibrium model of benefit design endogenizes plan characteristics and accounts for asymmetric information; the model estimates confirm that differential incentives to internalize medical care offsets can explain disparities across plans. Counterfactuals show that strategic insurer incentives are as important as asymmetric information in determining benefit design.},

In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman’s widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

This lecture uses several empirical examples, mostly involving charter and exam schools, to highlight the value of LATE. A surprising exclusion restriction, an assumption central to the LATE interpretation of IV estimates, is shown to explain why enrollment at Chicago exam schools reduces student achievement. I also make two broader points: IV exclusion restrictions formalize commitment to clear and consistent explanations of reduced-form causal effects; compelling applications demonstrate the power of simple empirical strategies to generate new causal knowledge.},

My analysis failed to detect a significant change in referral patterns to either low-mortality or high-mortality cardiac surgeons.

Causal effects estimated via multiple regression differentially weight each unit's contribution. The “effective sample” that regression uses to generate the estimate may bear little resemblance to the population of interest, and the results may be nonrepresentative in a manner similar to what quasi-experimental methods or experiments with convenience samples produce. There is no general external validity basis for preferring multiple regression on representative samples over quasi-experimental or experimental methods. We show how to estimate the “multiple regression weights” that allow one to study the effective sample. We discuss alternative approaches that, under certain conditions, recover representative average causal effects. The requisite conditions cannot always be met.},

We establish the nonasymptotic bounds for these deep nets for a general class of nonparametric regression-type loss functions, which includes as special cases least squares, logistic regression, and other generalized linear models.

	abstract = {Consumers' enrollment decisions in Medicare Part D can be explained by Abaluck and Gruber's (2011) model of utility maximization with psychological biases or by a neoclassical version of their model that precludes such biases. We evaluate these competing hypotheses by applying nonparametric tests of utility maximization and model validation tests to administrative data. We find that 79 percent of enrollment decisions from 2006 to 2010 satisfied basic axioms of consumer theory under the assumption of full information. The validation tests provide evidence against widespread psychological biases. In particular, we find that precluding psychological biases improves the structural model's out-of-sample predictions for consumer behavior.},

value plan financial characteristics beyond any impacts on their

	abstract = {This paper outlines recently developed techniques for estimating the primitives needed to empirically analyze equilibrium interactions and their implications in oligopolistic markets. It is divided into an introduction and three sections; a section on estimating demand functions, a section on estimating production functions, and a section on estimating “dynamic” parameters (parameters estimated through their implications on the choice of controls which determine the distribution of future profits). The introduction provides an overview of how these primitives are used in typical I.O. applications, and explains how the individual sections are structured. The topics of the three sections have all been addressed in prior literature. Consequently each section begins with a review of the problems I.O. researchers encountered in using the prior approaches. The sections then continue with a fairly detailed explanation of the recent techniques and their relationship to the problems with the prior approaches. Hopefully the detail is rich enough to enable the reader to actually program up a version of the techniques and use them to analyze data. We conclude each section with a brief discussion of some of the problems with the more recent techniques. Here the emphasis is on when those problems are likely to be particularly important, and on recent research designed to overcome them when they are.},

Like in fixed effects panel data analyses, the joint distribution of observed and unobserved agent-level characteristics is left unrestricted. Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter, β0, are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic sequence involving a single network growing large. The first, tetrad logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree heterogeneity. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity Ai0i = 1N as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated. The TL estimate is consistent under both sparse and dense graph sequences, whereas consistency of the JML estimate is shown only under dense graph sequences.},

	abstract = {In the United States, hospitals and physicians independently negotiate contracts with insurers. Therefore, a privately insured individual can be treated at an in-network hospital’s emergency department but receive a large unexpected bill from an out-of-network emergency physician working at that facility. Because patients do not choose their emergency physician, emergency physicians can remain out of network and charge high prices without losing patient volume. We illustrate that this strong outside option improves physicians’ bargaining power with insurers. We conclude by analyzing New York’s efforts to address out-of-network billing through binding arbitration between physicians and insurers over out-of-network payments. This intervention reduced out-of-network billing by 12.8 percentage points (88\%).},

	abstract = {We develop results for the use of Lasso and post-Lasso methods to form first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many instruments, p. Our results apply even when p is much larger than the sample size, n. We show that the IV estimator based on using Lasso or post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when the first stage is approximately sparse, that is, when the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose identities may be unknown. We also show that the estimator is semiparametrically efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably, our results allow for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic “beta-min” conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following model selection (see also Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2011b)). In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark. Optimal instruments are conditional expectations. In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso and post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances that uses a data-weighted ℓ1-penalty function. By innovatively using moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence rates for the resulting Lasso and post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition that logp = o(n1/3). We also provide a data-driven method for choosing the penalty level that must be specified in obtaining Lasso and post-Lasso estimates and establish its asymptotic validity under non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances.},

	abstract = {Self-control problems constitute a potential explanation for the under-investment in preventive health care observed in low-income countries. A commonly proposed policy tool to solve such problems is oﬀering consumers commitment devices. We conduct a ﬁeld experiment to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent types of theoretically-motivated commitment contracts in increasing preventive doctor visits by hypertensive patients in rural India. We document varying levels of takeup of the diﬀerent commitment contracts, but ﬁnd no eﬀects on actual doctor visits or individual health outcomes. Thus, a substantial number of individuals pay for commitments, but then fail to follow through on the speciﬁed task, losing money without experiencing any health beneﬁt. We develop and structurally estimate a pre-speciﬁed model of consumer behavior under present bias with varying levels of naivete. The results are consistent with a large share of individuals being partially naive about their own self-control problems; in other words, they are sophisticated enough to demand some commitment, but overly optimistic about whether a given commitment is suﬃciently strong to be eﬀective. The results suggest that commitment devices may in practice be welfare diminishing, at least in some contexts, and serve as a cautionary tale about the role of these contracts in the health care sector.},

Under selection on observables, we construct confidence intervals using a doubly-robust estimator that are robust to model selection errors and prove their uniform validity over a large class of models that allows for multivalued treatments with heterogeneous effects and selection amongst (possibly) more covariates than observations. The semiparametric efficiency bound is attained under appropriate conditions. Precise conditions are given for any model selector to yield these results, and we specifically propose the group lasso, which is apt for treatment effects, and derive new results for high-dimensional, sparse multinomial logistic regression. Both a simulation study and revisiting the National Supported Work demonstration show our estimator performs well in finite samples.},

	abstract = {Hospitals face large and variable costs from treating indigent care patients. Two methods of “reinsuring” hospitals against these costs are providing these patients with insurance and directly providing hospitals with supplemental payments to cover the expected costs of treating the indigent. Currently, the U.S. uses a hybrid of these approaches, insuring some indigent patients through Medicaid and providing hospitals with supplemental payments through programs such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share. We evaluate the economic fundamentals of supplemental payments in the U.S. safety net. We find that providing indigent care patients with insurance and providing hospitals with supplement payments are imperfect substitutes to hospitals because they differ in the extent to which they protect hospitals from risk, incentivize cost control, and and incentivize certain investments. Overall, we find that supplemental payments are used to increase access to hospitals in areas with many indigent patients, rather than to provide efficient intertemporal risk-protection to hospitals or incentivize cost control.},

RUM assumes that decision makers behave as if they maximize a rational preference over a choice set. This assumption may fail when consideration of all alternatives is costly. We provide a theoretical and statistical framework that unifies well-known models of random (limited) consideration and generalizes them to allow for preference heterogeneity. We apply this methodology in a novel stochastic dataset that we collected in a large-scale online experiment. Our dataset is unique since it exhibits both choice set and (attention) frame variation. We run a statistical survival race between competing models of random consideration and RUM. We find that RUM cannot explain the population behavior. In contrast, we cannot reject the hypothesis that decision makers behave according to the logit attention model (Brady and Rehbeck, 2016). JEL classification numbers: C90, C12, D81, D12.},

Pre-merger price variation across hospitals (Gini coefficient 7\%) suggests significant opportunities for cost decreases. However, we observe limited evidence of actual savings. In this retrospective study, targets realized 1.9\% savings; acquirers realized no significant savings. Examining treatment effect heterogeneity to shed light on theories of “buyer power,” we find that savings, when they occur, tend to be local, and potential benefits of savings may be offset by managerial costs of merging.},

	url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w24003},
	abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

We emphasize that heterogeneity in efficient coverage level is not sufficient to motivate choice. When premiums cannot reflect individuals' costs, it may not be in consumers' best interest to select their efficient coverage level. We show that vertical choice is efficient only if consumers with higher willingness to pay have a higher efficient level of coverage. We investigate this condition empirically and find that as long as a minimum coverage level can be enforced, the welfare gains from vertical choice are either zero or economically small.},

	abstract = {Measuring consumer responsiveness to medical care prices is a central issue in health economics and a key ingredient in the optimal design and regulation of health insurance markets. We leverage a natural experiment at a large self-insured firm that required all of its employees to switch from an insurance plan that provided free health care to a nonlinear, high-deductible plan. The switch caused a spending reduction between 11.8\% and 13.8\% of total firm-wide health spending. We decompose this spending reduction into the components of (i) consumer price shopping, (ii) quantity reductions, and (iii) quantity substitutions and find that spending reductions are entirely due to outright reductions in quantity. We find no evidence of consumers learning to price shop after two years in high-deductible coverage. Consumers reduce quantities across the spectrum of health care services, including potentially valuable care (e.g., preventive services) and potentially wasteful care (e.g., imaging services). To better understand these changes, we study how consumers respond to the complex structure of the high-deductible contract. Consumers respond heavily to spot prices at the time of care, reducing their spending by 42\% when under the deductible, conditional on their true expected end-of-year price and their prior year end-of-year marginal price. There is no evidence of learning to respond to the true shadow price in the second year post-switch.},

In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does.},

	abstract = {We study regressions with period and group fixed effects and several treatment variables. Under a parallel trends assumption, the coefficient on each treatment identifies the sum of two terms. The first term is a weighted sum of the effect of that treatment in each group and period, with weights that may be negative and sum to one. The second term is a sum of the effects of the other treatments, with weights summing to zero. Accordingly, coefficients in those regressions are not robust to heterogeneous effects, and may be contaminated by the effect of other treatments. We propose alternative differences-in-differences estimators. To estimate, say, the effect of the first treatment, our estimators compare the outcome evolution of a group whose first treatment changes while its other treatments remain unchanged, to control groups whose treatments all remain unchanged, and with the same baseline treatments or treatments' history as the switching group. Those carefully selected comparisons are robust to heterogeneous effects, and do not suffer from the contamination problem.},

	abstract = {Objective To compare methods of price measurement in health care markets. Data Sources Truven Health Analytics MarketScan commercial claims. Study Design We constructed medical prices indices using three approaches: (1) a “sentinel” service approach based on a single common service in a specific clinical domain, (2) a market basket approach, and (3) a spending decomposition approach. We constructed indices at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level and estimated correlations between and within them. Principal Findings Price indices using a spending decomposition approach were strongly and positively correlated with indices constructed from broad market baskets of common services (r {\textgreater} 0.95). Prices of single common services exhibited weak to moderate correlations with each other and other measures. Conclusions Market-level price measures that reflect broad sets of services are likely to rank markets similarly. Price indices relying on individual sentinel services may be more appropriate for examining specialty- or service-specific drivers of prices.},

We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.},

I study the interpretation of the OLS estimands in such models when treatment effects are heterogeneous. I show that the treatment coefficient is a convex combination of two parameters, which under certain conditions can be interpreted as the average treatment effects on the treated and untreated. The weights on these parameters are inversely related to the proportion of observations in each group. Reliance on these implicit weights can have serious consequences for applied work, as I illustrate with two well-known applications. I develop simple diagnostic tools that empirical researchers can use to avoid potential biases. Software for implementing these methods is available in R and Stata. In an important special case, my diagnostics only require the knowledge of the proportion of treated units.},

	abstract = {This article is about estimation and inference methods for high dimensional sparse (HDS) regression models in econometrics. High dimensional sparse models arise in situations where many regressors (or series terms) are available and the regression function is well-approximated by a parsimonious, yet unknown set of regressors. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the entire regression function effectively by searching for approximately the right set of regressors. We discuss methods for identifying this set of regressors and estimating their coefficients based on \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-penalization and describe key theoretical results. In order to capture realistic practical situations, we expressly allow for imperfect selection of regressors and study the impact of this imperfect selection on estimation and inference results. We focus the main part of the article on the use of HDS models and methods in the instrumental variables model and the partially linear model. We present a set of novel inference results for these models and illustrate their use with applications to returns to schooling and growth regression.},

Our methodology accommodates average, distributional, and quantile treatment effects under different identifying assumptions including unconfoundedness, local treatment effects, and nonlinear differences-in-differences. The proposed estimators are easy to implement, have close-form representation, are fully data-driven upon estimation of nuisance parameters, and do not rely on parametric distributional assumptions, shape restrictions, or on restricting the potential treatment effect heterogeneity across different subpopulations. These treatment effects results are obtained as a consequence of more general results on two-step Kaplan-Meier estimators that are of independent interest: we provide conditions for applying (i) uniform law of large numbers, (ii) functional central limit theorems, and (iii) we prove the validity of the ordinary nonparametric bootstrap in a two-step estimation procedure where the outcome of interest may be randomly censored.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we provide efficient estimators and honest confidence bands for a variety of treatment effects including local average (LATE) and local quantile treatment effects (LQTE) in data-rich environments. We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced-form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced-form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets. The results on program evaluation are obtained as a consequence of more general results on honest inference in a general moment-condition framework, which arises from structural equation models in econometrics. Here, too, the crucial ingredient is the use of orthogonal moment conditions, which can be constructed from the initial moment conditions. We provide results on honest inference for (function-valued) parameters within this general framework where any high-quality, machine learning methods (e.g., boosted trees, deep neural networks, random forest, and their aggregated and hybrid versions) can be used to learn the nonparametric/high-dimensional components of the model. These include a number of supporting auxiliary results that are of major independent interest: namely, we (1) prove uniform validity of a multiplier bootstrap, (2) offer a uniformly valid functional delta method, and (3) provide results for sparsity-based estimation of regression functions for function-valued outcomes.},

	abstract = {Treatment intensity varies remarkably across physicians, yet the key drivers are not well understood. Meanwhile, the organization of healthcare is undergoing a secular transformation as physicians increasingly work in groups. This paper tests whether physicians' group affiliation matters for practice styles and patient health. Using Medicare inpatient claims data, we compare these outcomes before and after physicians switch between groups of varying treatment intensity while remaining in the same hospital to control for practice setting. Event studies show that internists who join more-intensive groups immediately increase their own treatment intensity, with an elasticity of approximately 0.3; the opposite is found for internists who switch to groups that are less intensive. This change in Medicare spending largely stems from greater quantities of care provided, with some evidence of a change in coding behavior. We do not detect a change in health outcomes, suggesting that treatment intensity induced by group affiliation may not be productive.},

We then link these changes to effects on hospital finances. We show that a substantial share of the federally funded Medicaid expansion substituted for existing locally funded safety net programs. Despite this offset, the expansion produced a substantial increase in hospital revenue, reflected in an equivalent increase in operating surplus. We do not detect improvements in patient mortality, although the expansion led to substantially greater hospital and emergency room use. (JEL H51, H75, I12, I13, I18, I38)},

	abstract = {Small-area-variation studies have shown that physician treatment styles differ substantially both between and within markets, controlling for patient characteristics. Using data on the universe of deliveries in Florida and New York over a 15-year period, we examine why treatment styles differ across obstetricians at a point in time and why styles change over time. We find that variation in c-section rates across physicians within a market is about twice as large as variation between markets. Surprisingly, residency programs explain no more than four percent of the variation in physicians’ risk-adjusted c-section rates, even among newly trained physicians. Although we find evidence that physicians learn from their peers, they do not substantially revise their prior beliefs regarding treatment due to the local exchange of information. Our results indicate that physicians are not likely to converge over time to a community standard; thus, within-market variation in treatment styles is likely to persist.},

To do so, we exploit recent variation in vertical structure in the US carbonated-beverage industry. While the elimination of double marginalization with vertical integration is normally characterized as procompetitive, economic theory predicts that it may cause anticompetitive price increases in multiproduct industries. We indeed find that vertical integration causes price decreases in products with eliminated double margins but price increases in the other products sold by the integrated firm. These results provide new evidence of anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers.},

	abstract = {We leverage two unique natural experiments to show that, in public drug insurance for the low-income elderly in the U.S., defaults have large and persistent effects on plan enrollment and beneficiary drug utilization. We estimate that when a beneficiary's default is exogenously changed from one year to the next, 96\% of beneficiaries follow that default. We then develop a general framework for choice under costly cognition that allows for the possibility that either paternalistic defaults that steer consumers to plans that suit them (Thaler and Sunstein 2008) or `shocking' defaults that trigger consumers to make active choices (Carroll et al. 2009) could be optimal. We show that optimal default design depends on a previously-overlooked parameter: The elasticity of active choice propensity with respect to the value of the default. Leveraging variation in the match value of randomly-assigned default plans, we estimate an elasticity close to zero: There is little difference in the probability of active choice between beneficiaries assigned a well-matched default versus beneficiaries assigned a poorly-matched default. We also show that this passivity has real consequences, with beneficiaries assigned poorly-matched defaults experiencing large declines in drug consumption relative to those assigned well-matched defaults. This suggests that any potential welfare gains from an active choice response induced by a poorly-matched default are likely to be small and outweighed by the welfare losses due to reductions in drug consumption among beneficiaries who follow the poorly-matched default. Using a third natural experiment and a structural model of attention, we find that the little active choice that is present in this market appears to be largely random, with two-thirds of the variation in active choice coming from within-beneficiary transitory shocks to attention. Our results show that default rules are an integral part of insurance market design and that beneficiaries are likely to benefit from paternalistic defaults rather than be hurt by them.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates consumer inertia in health insurance markets,
where adverse selection is a potential concern. We leverage a major
change to insurance provision that occurred at a large firm to
identify substantial inertia, and develop and estimate a choice model
that also quantifies risk preferences and ex ante health risk. We use
these estimates to study the impact of policies that nudge consumers
toward better decisions by reducing inertia. When aggregated,
these improved individual-level choices substantially exacerbate
adverse selection in our setting, leading to an overall reduction in
welfare that doubles the existing welfare loss from adverse selection.},

	abstract = {Medicare spending varies more than twofold among regions, and the variations persist even after differences in health are corrected for. Higher levels of Medicare spending are due largely to increased use of "supply-sensitive" services - physician visits, specialist consultations, and hospitalizations, particularly for those with chronic illnesses or in their last six months of life. Also, higher spending does not result in more effective care, elevated rates of elective surgery, or better health outcomes. To improve the quality and efficiency of care, we propose a new approach to Medicare reform based on the principles of shared decision making and the promotion of centers of medical excellence. We suggest that our proposal be tested in a major demonstration project. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We find that prior to the ACA expansions, mortality rates across expansion and nonexpansion states trended similarly, but beginning in the first year of the policy, there were significant reductions in mortality in states that opted to expand relative to nonexpanders. Individuals in expansion states experienced a 0.132 percentage point decline in annual mortality, a 9.4\% reduction over the sample mean, as a result of the Medicaid expansions. The effect is driven by a reduction in disease-related deaths and grows over time. A variety of alternative specifications, methods of inference, placebo tests, and sample definitions confirm our main result.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been very few published studies of referral management among commercially insured populations and none on referral management from employer-sponsored health centers.
OBJECTIVE: Describe the referral management system of an integrated employer-sponsored health care system and compare specialist referral rates and costs of specialist visits between those initiated from employer-sponsored health clinics and those initiated from community providers.
DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative cohort study using multivariate analysis of medical claims comparing care initiated in employer-sponsored health clinics with propensity-matched controls having specialist referrals initiated by community providers.
PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 years) eligible for employer-sponsored clinical services incurring medical claims for specialist referrals between 12/1/2018 and 12/31/2020. The study cohort was comprised of 3129 receiving more than 75\% of their care in the employer-sponsored clinic matched to a cohort of 3129 patients receiving care in the community.
INTERVENTION: Specialist referral management program implemented by Crossover Health employer-sponsored clinics.
MAIN MEASURES: Rates and costs of specialist referrals.
KEY RESULTS: The relative rate of specialist referrals was 22\% lower among patients receiving care in employers-sponsored health clinics (35.1\%) than among patients receiving care in the community (45\%, p {\textless}0.001). The total per-user per-month cost for patients in the study cohort was \$372 (SD \$894), compared to \$401 (SD \$947) for the community cohort, a difference of \$29 (p{\textless}0.001) and a relative reduction of 7.2\%. The lower costs can be attributed, in part, to lower specialist care costs (\$63 (SD \$140) vs \$76 (SD \$213) (p{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Employer-sponsored health clinics can provide effective integrated care and may be able to reduce avoidable specialist utilization. Standardized referral management and care navigation may drive lower specialist spend, when referrals are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physician referrals play a central role in ambulatory care in the United States; however, little is known about national trends in physician referrals over time. The objective of this study was to assess changes in the annual rate of referrals to other physicians from physician office visits in the United States from 1999 to 2009.
METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative cross-sections of ambulatory patient visits in the United States, using a sample of 845 243 visits from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1993 to 2009, focusing on the decade from 1999 to 2009. The main outcome measures were survey-weighted estimates of the total number and percentage of visits resulting in a referral to another physician across several patient and physician characteristics.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2009, the probability that an ambulatory visit to a physician resulted in a referral to another physician increased from 4.8\% to 9.3\% (P {\textless} .001), a 94\% increase. The absolute number of visits resulting in a physician referral increased 159\% nationally during this time, from 41 million to 105 million. This trend was consistent across all subgroups examined, except for slower growth among physicians with ownership stakes in their practice (P = .02) or those with the majority of income from managed care contracts (P = .007). Changes in referral rates varied according to the principal symptoms accounting for patients' visits, with significant increases noted for visits to primary care physicians from patients with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, orthopedic, dermatologic, and ear/nose/throat symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The percentage and absolute number of ambulatory visits resulting in a referral in the United States grew substantially from 1999 to 2009. More research is necessary to understand the contribution of rising referral rates to costs of care.},

We find roughly 40\% of the geographic variation in the share selecting private coverage is due to place-based factors, while the remainder is explained by individuals. Our findings highlight the importance of individual factors in these decisions and may inform discussions about the use of policy to address geographic disparities.},

	abstract = {Using data from over 300,000 visits to an emergency department (ED), we study the accuracy of gatekeeping decisions—the choices that physicians make regarding patient discharge or admission to the hospital. In our study context, we focus specifically on the effectiveness of a second gatekeeping stage in the ED—a clinical decision unit (CDU). Although only 9.9\% of patients in our sample are routed through the CDU, we find that had the unit not been in place during the observation period, the rates of unnecessary hospitalization and wrongful patient discharge from the ED would have increased by 14.3\% and 29.6\%, respectively. We also find that the CDU is especially beneficial for patients with a high ex ante risk of experiencing unnecessary hospitalization, with the rate for the most high-risk patients reduced from 14.0\% without the CDU to just 4.8\% had all such patients been routed through the CDU. The appropriateness of referrals is therefore a key contributor to the CDU’s effectiveness: We estimate that random allocation of patients in our study hospital to the CDU would have reduced the unit’s effectiveness by more than half. Finally, we investigate a critical trade-off in designing a two-stage gatekeeping system: Resources must be split between the two stages, increasing congestion in the first stage when the second stage is enlarged. We demonstrate that in the study hospital, the combination of an ED and CDU performs better than a pooled system that combines the capacity of both stages to enlarge the ED but does not have a designated CDU. In fact, we estimate that in this specific case, reducing the size of the first-stage ED in order to expand CDU capacity from the current 9.9\% of ED patients to 25\% would further reduce unnecessary hospitalizations by up to 33\%. We discuss the insights that these results provide as to the circumstances under which it may be advantageous to add a second stage to a gatekeeping system.

	abstract = {Financial distress among rural hospitals in the US has increased in recent years. Using national hospital data, we investigated how the decline in profitability has affected hospital survival, either independently or with a merger. The answer has direct implications for access to care and competition in rural markets. We assessed the rate of hospital closures and mergers in predominantly rural markets during the period 2010–18, focusing on hospitals that were unprofitable at baseline. A minority of unprofitable hospitals (7 percent) closed. A larger share (17 percent) merged, most commonly with organizations from outside of their local geographic market. Most unprofitable hospitals (77 percent) continued to operate through 2018 without closure or merger. About half of these hospitals returned to profitability. At the market level, 22 percent of markets served by unprofitable hospitals lost a competitor to closure or within-market merger. Out-of-market mergers affected 33 percent of markets with an unprofitable hospital. Overall, our results suggest that rural markets are experiencing meaningful rates of hospital closures and mergers, yet many hospitals have survived despite poor financial performance. Policies targeting access to care will continue to be important. Similar attention will be needed to address the competitive effects of hospital closures and mergers on prices and quality.},

	abstract = {The prices that private insurers pay hospitals have received considerable attention in recent years, but most of that literature has focused on the commercially insured population. Although nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, little is known about the prices paid to hospitals by the private insurers that administer such plans. More information on the hospital prices paid by MA plans would provide additional insights into whether MA prices are more closely tied to Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) prices or commercial prices. Moreover, information on whether the hospital prices paid by MA plans vary with market characteristics or other factors would be useful for evaluating the performance of the MA program and analyzing proposals to modify it. In this study, we compared the hospital prices paid by MA plans and commercial plans with Medicare FFS prices using 2013 claims from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI) database. The HCCI claims were used to calculate hospital prices for private insurers, and Medicare’s payment rules were used to estimate Medicare FFS prices. We focused on stays at acute care hospitals in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). We found MA prices to be roughly equal to Medicare FFS prices, on average, but commercial prices were 89\% higher than FFS prices. In addition, commercial prices varied greatly across and within MSAs, but MA prices varied much less.},

The cost-shifting narrative and the empirical strategies used to evaluate it typically assume no connection between public prices and the number of hospitals operating in the market (market structure). We raise the possibility of “consolidation-induced cost shifting,” which recognizes that changes in public prices for hospital care can affect market structure and, through that mechanism, affect commercial prices. We investigated the first leg of that argument: that public payment may affect hospital market structure. After controlling for many confounders, we found that hospitals with a higher share of Medicare patients had lower and more rapidly declining profits and an increased likelihood of closure or acquisition compared with hospitals that were less reliant on Medicare. This is consistent with the existence of consolidation-induced cost shifting and implies that reductions in public prices must be undertaken cautiously. Mechanisms to limit closure- or acquisition-induced increases in commercial hospital prices may be important.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the dynamic effects of competition and hospital market position on rural hospital closures.
DATA SOURCE/STUDY SETTING: Analysis of all rural community hospitals operating between 1984 and 1991, with the exception of sole-provider hospitals. Data for the study are obtained from four sources: the AHA Annual Surveys of Hospitals, the HCFA Cost Reports, the Area Resource File, and a hospital address file constructed by Geographic Inc.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Variables are merged to construct pooled, time-series observations for study hospitals. Hospital closure is specified as a function of hospital market position, market level competition, and control variables. Discrete-time logistic regressions are used to test hypotheses.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rural hospitals operating in markets with higher density had higher risk of closure. Rural hospitals that differentiated from others in the market on the basis of geographic distance, basic services, and high-tech services had lower risks of closure. Effects of market density on closure disappeared when market position was included in the model, indicating that differentiation in markets should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of competition on rural hospital closure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that rural hospitals can reduce competitive pressures through differentiation and that accurate measures of competition in geographically defined market areas are critical for understanding competitive dynamics among rural hospitals.},

	doi = {10.1001/jama.2011.620},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Between 1998 and 2008, the number of hospital-based emergency departments (EDs) in the United States declined, while the number of ED visits increased, particularly visits by patients who were publicly insured and uninsured. Little is known about the hospital, community, and market factors associated with ED closures. Federal law requiring EDs to treat all in need regardless of a patient's ability to pay may make EDs more vulnerable to the market forces that govern US health care.
OBJECTIVE: To determine hospital, community, and market factors associated with ED closures.
DESIGN: Emergency department and hospital organizational information from 1990 through 2009 was acquired from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Surveys (annual response rates ranging from 84\%-92\%) and merged with hospital financial and payer mix information available through 2007 from Medicare hospital cost reports. We evaluated 3 sets of risk factors: hospital characteristics (safety net [as defined by hospitals caring for more than double their Medicaid share of discharges compared with other hospitals within a 15-mile radius], ownership, teaching status, system membership, ED size, case mix), county population demographics (race, poverty, uninsurance, elderly), and market factors (ownership mix, profit margin, location in a competitive market, presence of other EDs).
SETTING: All general, acute, nonrural, short-stay hospitals in the United States with an operating ED anytime from 1990-2009.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Closure of an ED during the study period.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2009, the number of hospitals with EDs in nonrural areas declined from 2446 to 1779, with 1041 EDs closing and 374 hospitals opening EDs. Based on analysis of 2814 urban acute-care hospitals, constituting 36,335 hospital-year observations over an 18-year study interval (1990-2007), for-profit hospitals and those with low profit margins were more likely to close than their counterparts (cumulative hazard rate based on bivariate model, 26\% vs 16\%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.1, and 36\% vs 18\%; HR, 1.9; 95\% CI, 1.6-2.3, respectively). Hospitals in more competitive markets had a significantly higher risk of closing their EDs (34\% vs 17\%; HR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.6), as did safety-net hospitals (10\% vs 6\%; HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.7) and those serving a higher share of populations in poverty (37\% vs 31\%; HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.7).
CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2009, the number of hospital EDs in nonrural areas declined by 27\%, with for-profit ownership, location in a competitive market, safety-net status, and low profit margin associated with increased risk of ED closure.},

Enrollees assigned to narrower networks use fewer of both needed and unneeded services and are less satisfied with their plans.

We show that differential information about provider quality is an important determinant of this disparity. Our empirical strategy exploits the temporary presence of a website that publicly displayed summary star ratings of general practitioner (GP) offices in England. Regression discontinuity estimates show that patient demand responds sharply to the information on the website, and that this response is almost entirely driven by residents of low income neighborhoods. The results are consistent with high income patients having better private information about quality. We incorporate our estimates into a structural model of demand that allows for heterogeneity in information, preferences, and consumer inertia. We find that information differences explain 24 percent of the relationship between income and GP quality and reinforce disparities in access to care.},

	abstract = {US healthcare is undergoing a period of substantial change, with many hospitals vertically integrating with physician practices. Such integration could improve quality by promoting care coordination, but could also worsen it by impacting care delivery. Evidence on how physicians alter their behavior from the changes in financial ownership and the incentive structures of the integrated organizations is scant. We examine Medicare patients treated by gastroenterologists, a specialty with a recent increase in vertical integration. Using a causal model and large-scale patient-level national panel data that include 2.6 million patient visits across 5,488 physicians, we examine changes in various measures of care delivery. We find that physicians significantly alter care processes (e.g., in using anesthesia with deep sedation) after they vertically integrate, and that patients' post-procedure complications increase substantially. We provide evidence that the financial incentive structure of the integrated practices is the main reason for the changes in physician behavior, since it discourages the integrated practices from allocating expensive resources to relatively unprofitable procedures. Although integration improves operational efficiency measured by physicians' throughput, it negatively affects quality and overall spending. We note some potential policy levers through which policymakers could mitigate the negative consequences of vertical integration.},

A major concern in this system is overbilling, waste and fraud by providers, who face incentives to misreport on their claims in order to receive higher payments. In this work, we develop novel machine learning tools to identify providers that overbill insurers. Using large-scale claims data from Medicare, the US federal health insurance program for elderly adults and the disabled, we identify patterns consistent with fraud or overbilling among inpatient hospitalizations. Our proposed approach for fraud detection is fully unsupervised, not relying on any labeled training data, and is explainable to end users, providing reasoning and interpretable insights into the potentially suspicious behavior of the flagged providers. Data from the Department of Justice on providers facing anti-fraud lawsuits and case studies of suspicious providers validate our approach and findings. We also perform a post-analysis to understand hospital characteristics, those not used for detection but associate with a high suspiciousness score. Our method provides an 8-fold lift over random targeting, and can be used to guide investigations and auditing of suspicious providers for both public and private health insurance systems.},

To prevent insurers from passing through aggregate risks to consumers, governments have increasingly adopted dynamic pricing regulations that limit insurers' ability to change premiums over time. This paper develops and estimates an equilibrium model with dynamic pricing and firm entry and uses it to evaluate the design of dynamic pricing regulations in the U.S. long-term care insurance (LTCI) market. We find that stricter dynamic pricing regulation lowers social welfare as the benefit from improved premium stability is outweighed by the cost of reduced insurer participation. The welfare loss from stricter dynamic pricing regulation could be mitigated if the government also expands public LTCI through Medicaid.},

We use both panel-data methods and case studies from state-wide Medicaid disenrollments and find that the uncompensated care costs of hospitals increase in response to the size of the uninsured population. The results suggest that each additional uninsured person costs local hospitals \$900 each year in uncompensated care. Similarly, the closure of a nearby hospital increases the uncompensated care costs of remaining hospitals. Increases in the uninsured population also lower hospital profit margins, which suggests that hospitals cannot simply pass along all increased costs onto privately insured patients. For-profit hospitals are less affected by these factors, suggesting that non-profit hospitals serve a unique role as part of the social insurance system.},

We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors. We also show how decomposing the overall employment effect by wage bins allows a transparent way of assessing the plausibility of estimates.},

GPs also increase their co-prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines, a practice that goes against prescribing guidelines. These effects are more pronounced in areas with more NPs per GP at baseline and are concentrated in physician specialties that compete most directly with NPs. Our findings are consistent with a simple model of physician behavior in which competition for patients leads physicians to move toward the preferences of marginal patients.

We study potential trade-offs in the US hospital sector where public control declined by 42\% over 1983–2019. Private operators may improve hospitals’ financial performance, but a focus on profitability may adversely affect access to care for certain patients. Using national data across all hospitals and patients, we study 258 hospital privatizations over the 2000–2018 period. Private operators improve profitability so that hospitals generate a modest surplus, primarily by increasing mean revenue per patient. However, this is partly achieved by differentially reducing the intake of low-income Medicaid patients, who are typically less profitable than other groups due to lower reimbursement rates. While other patients appear to be absorbed by neighboring hospitals, Medicaid patients experience an aggregate decline in utilization at the market-level, which we interpret as a decline in access to care. Hospital privatization therefore partially offsets the benefits of providing publicly funded health insurance through Medicaid, and our estimates imply it is quantitatively important. The aggregate decline in Medicaid volume is detected only in more concentrated hospital markets, suggesting market power is a key driver.},

I show that the treatment coefficient is a convex combination of two parameters, which under certain conditions can be interpreted as the average treatment effects on the treated and untreated. The weights on these parameters are inversely related to the proportion of observations in each group. Reliance on these implicit weights can have serious consequences for applied work, as I illustrate with two well-known applications. I develop simple diagnostic tools that empirical researchers can use to avoid potential biases. Software for implementing these methods is available in R and Stata. In an important special case, my diagnostics require only the knowledge of the proportion of treated units.},

We assess the role of racial concordance between patients and medical providers in driving use of preventive care and the implications for patient outcomes. We use unique data from the Military Health System, where we observe providers as patients so that we can identify their race, and where moves across bases change exposure to provider race. We consider patients with four chronic, deadly, but ultimately manageable illnesses, where the relationship with the provider may have the most direct and important impact on health. We find striking evidence that racial concordance leads to improved maintenance of preventive care – and ultimately lower patient mortality. Pooling across these diseases, we estimate that a one-standard deviation increase in the share of providers who are Black leads to a 15\% relative decline in Black mortality among those with these manageable illnesses. Our results further suggest that between 55 and 69\% of this mortality impact arises through improved medication use and adherence, with other aspects of the provider-patient relationship accounting for the residual.},

	abstract = {The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-experimental design for causal inference and policy evaluation. The most common inference approaches in RD designs employ “flexible” parametric and nonparametric local polynomial methods, which rely on extrapolation and large-sample approximations of conditional expectations using observations somewhat near the cutoff that determines treatment assignment. An alternative inference approach employs the idea of local randomization, where the very few units closest to the cutoff are regarded as randomly assigned to treatment and finite-sample exact inference methods are used. In this paper, we contrast these approaches empirically by re-analyzing the influential findings of Ludwig and Miller (), who studied the effect of Head Start assistance on child mortality employing parametric RD methods. We first review methods based on approximations of conditional expectations, which are relatively well developed in the literature, and then present new methods based on randomization inference. In particular, we extend the local randomization framework to allow for parametric adjustments of the potential outcomes; our extended framework substantially relaxes strong assumptions in prior literature and better resembles other RD inference methods. We compare all these methods formally, focusing on both estimands and inference properties. In addition, we develop new approaches for randomization-based sensitivity analysis specifically tailored to RD designs. Applying all these methods to the Head Start data, we find that the original RD treatment effect reported in the literature is quite stable and robust, an empirical finding that enhances the credibility of the original result. All the empirical methods we discuss are readily available in general purpose software in R and Stata; we also provide the dataset and software code needed to replicate all our results.},

We derive theoretical results and present simulation and empirical evidence showing that these CIs do not guard against model misspecification, and that they have poor coverage properties. We 
therefore recommend against using these CIs in practice. We instead propose two alternative CIs with guaranteed coverage properties under easily interpretable restrictions on the conditional expectation function.},

However, in observational studies, the variables of interest (e.g., education, prices) are often endogenous, making conventional quantile regression inconsistent and hence inappropriate for recovering the causal effects of these variables on the quantiles of economic outcomes. In order to address this problem, we develop a model of quantile treatment effects (QTE) in the presence of endogeneity and obtain conditions for identification of the QTE without functional form assumptions. The principal feature of the model is the imposition of conditions that restrict the evolution of ranks across treatment states. This feature allows us to overcome the endogeneity problem and recover the true QTE through the use of instrumental variables. The proposed model can also be equivalently viewed as a structural simultaneous equation model with nonadditive errors, where QTE can be interpreted as the structural quantile effects (SQE).},

We calculated the average price per admission, and its trend over time, in each of the three types of insurance for fixed baskets of hospital admissions across metropolitan areas. After accounting for differences in hospital networks, geographic areas, and case-mix between Medicare Advantage and FFS Medicare, we found that Medicare Advantage plans paid 5.6 percent less for hospital services than FFS Medicare did. Without taking into account the narrower networks of Medicare Advantage, the program paid 8.0 percent less than FFS Medicare. We also found that the rates paid by commercial plans were much higher than those of either Medicare Advantage or FFS Medicare, and growing. At least some of this difference comes from the much higher prices that commercial plans pay for profitable service lines.},

Respondents broadly identified three primary reasons for near–payment equivalence: statutory and regulatory provisions that limit out-of-network payments to traditional Medicare rates, de facto budget constraints that MA plans face because of the need to compete with traditional Medicare and other MA plans, and a market equilibrium that permits relatively lower MA rates as long as commercial rates remain well above the traditional Medicare rates. We explored a number of policy implications not only for the MA program but also for the problem of high and variable hospital prices in commercial insurance markets.},

	abstract = {Multiple parties influence the choice of facility for hospital-based inpatient and outpatient services. The patient is the central figure, but their choice of facility is guided by their physician and influenced by hospital characteristics. This study estimated changes in referral patterns for inpatient admissions and outpatient diagnostic imaging associated with changes in ownership of three multispecialty clinic systems headquartered in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN. These clinic systems were acquired by two hospital-owned integrated delivery systems (IDSs) in 2007, increasing the probability that hospital preferences influenced physician guidance on facility choice. We used a longitudinal dataset that allowed us to predict changes in referral patterns, controlling for health plan enrollee, coverage, and clinic system characteristics. The results are an important empirical contribution to the literature examining the impact of hospital ownership on location of service. When this change in ownership forged new relationships, there was a significant reduction in the use of facilities historically selected for inpatient admissions and outpatient imaging and an increase in the use of the acquiring IDS's facilities. These changes were weaker in the IDS acquiring two clinic systems, suggesting that management of multiple acquisitions simultaneously may impact the ability of the IDS to build strong referral relationships.

The design compares cohorts born in different years relative to Medicaid implementation, in states with different preexisting welfare-based eligibility. Early childhood Medicaid eligibility reduces mortality and disability, increases employment, and reduces receipt of disability transfer programs up to 50 years later. Medicaid has saved the government more than its original cost and saved more than 10 million quality adjusted life years. (JEL H51, I12, I18, I32, I38, J13)},

Data sources Responses to the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) Practice Survey and SK\&A data. Study design Comparison of CPC + Practice Survey responses to SK\&A information for 2698 primary care practice sites. Data collection CPC + Practice Survey data collected through a web-only survey from April through September 2017, and SK\&A data purchased in November 2016. Principal findings Information was similar across data sources, although some discrepancies were common. For example, 56\% of practice sites had differences in the reported number of practitioners, and larger sites tended to have larger differences. Among practice sites with 1 practitioner in the survey, only 1.3\% had a difference of 3 or more practitioners between the data sources, whereas 63\% of practice sites with 11 or more practitioners had a difference of 3 or more practitioners. Conclusions Discrepancies between data sources could reflect differences of interpretation when defining practice site characteristics, changes over time in those characteristics, or data errors in either SK\&A or the survey. Researchers using SK\&A data should consider possible ramifications for their studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in hospital outpatient surgery trends and case mix for Medicare and privately insured patients needing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) following Medicare's removal of TKA from its Inpatient Only list on January 1, 2018.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of all hospital discharge records in Florida from 2012 through 2018.
METHODS: We tracked inpatient vs outpatient performance of TKAs at the state and hospital levels. We also combined our primary data with physician practice organization information to assess variation in the policy response according to physician-hospital ownership status. Supplementary analyses examined policy-induced changes in inpatient TKA case mix.
RESULTS: We observed an immediate shift of roughly 15\% of Medicare TKA cases to the outpatient setting. Importantly, there was a simultaneous near doubling of the number of TKAs performed as a hospital outpatient procedure among privately insured patients younger than 60 years. Hospitals allocated a similar proportion of TKA cases to the outpatient setting across the 2 payer groups, and we found evidence of selection against the potentially riskiest Medicare TKA patients for outpatient delivery. Vertically integrated orthopedic physicians retained their Medicare and privately insured TKA cases within the inpatient (higher-cost) setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Market and financial pressures are encouraging more outpatient care delivery; however, the speed of transition is dictated, in part, by regulatory constraints. Our results suggest that Medicare policy may influence surgical treatment approaches for Medicare and privately insured patients. Spillover implications need to be considered when weighing future Medicare regulatory decisions.},

Cuts to the navigator program significantly decreased marketplace coverage and total coverage among lower-income adults, and significantly decreased total coverage among adults under age 45, Hispanic adults, and adults who speak a language other than English at home. We found no significant impact of the cuts on Medicaid enrollment (95 percent CI: −1.9 percentage points to 0.5 percentage points); most uninsured people in the states we studied lived in locations that had not implemented Medicaid eligibility expansions. These findings suggest that before the funding cuts, navigators were helping underserved consumers obtain coverage.},

It first specifies a testing problem in which the null hypothesis is that two networks are drawn from the same random graph model. It then describes two randomization tests based on the magnitude of the difference between the networks' adjacency matrices as measured by the 2 → 2 and ∞ → 1 operator norms. Power properties of the tests are examined analytically, in simulation, and through two real-world applications. A key finding is that the test based on the ∞ → 1 norm can be much more powerful for the kinds of sparse and degree-heterogeneous networks common in economics.},

We explore concordance in a setting where racial disparities are particularly severe: childbirth. In the United States, Black newborns die at three times the rate of White newborns. Results examining 1.8 million hospital births in the state of Florida between 1992 and 2015 suggest that newborn–physician racial concordance is associated with a significant improvement in mortality for Black infants. Results further suggest that these benefits manifest during more challenging births and in hospitals that deliver more Black babies. We find no significant improvement in maternal mortality when birthing mothers share race with their physician.},

We report four facts. (1) Black patients receive care at lower-performing hospitals than white patients, even when they live in the same hospital market or ZIP code within a hospital market. (2) Over the past two decades, the gap in performance between hospitals treating Black and white patients shrank by over two-thirds. (3) This progress is due to more rapid performance improvement at hospitals that tended to treat Black patients, rather than faster reallocation of Black patients to better hospitals. (4) Hospital performance improvement is correlated with adoption of a high-return low-cost input, beta-blockers. Closing remaining disparities in allocation and harnessing the forces of performance improvement, including technology diffusion, may be novel levers to further reduce disparities.},

They estimate that eliminating health disparities for minorities would have reduced direct medical care expenditures by about \$230 billion and indirect costs associated with illness and premature death by more than \$1 trillion for the years 2003?2006 (in 2008 inflation-adjusted dollars). We should address health disparities because such inequities are inconsistent with the values of our society and addressing them is the right thing to do, but this analysis shows that social justice can also be cost effective.},

Two quasi-experimental research designs—medical school admission lotteries and variation in the timing of medical degrees—support a causal interpretation of these effects. A hypothetical policy that would bring the same health behavior changes and benefits to all Swedes would close 18 percent of the mortality-income gradient. Our results suggest that socioeconomic differences in exposure to health-related expertise may meaningfully contribute to health inequality.},

Players meet sequentially at random, myopically updating their links. Under mild assumptions, the network formation process is a potential game and converges to an exponential random graph model (ERGM), generating directed dense networks. I provide new identification results for ERGMs in large networks: if link externalities are nonnegative, the ERGM is asymptotically indistinguishable from an Erdős–Rényi model with independent links. We can identify the parameters only when at least one of the externalities is negative and sufficiently large. However, the standard estimation methods for ERGMs can have exponentially slow convergence, even when the model has asymptotically independent links. I thus estimate parameters using a Bayesian MCMC method. When the parameters are identifiable, I show evidence that the estimation algorithm converges in almost quadratic time.},

We characterize network formation as a simultaneous-move game, where the utility from forming a link depends on the structure of the network, thereby generating strategic interactions between links. With the prevalence of multiple equilibria, the parameters are not necessarily point identified. We leave the equilibrium selection unrestricted and propose a partial identification approach. We derive bounds on the probability of observing a subnetwork, where a subnetwork is the restriction of a network to a subset of the individuals. Unlike the standard bounds as in Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), these subnetwork bounds are computationally tractable in large networks provided we consider small subnetworks. We provide Monte Carlo evidence that bounds from small subnetworks are informative in large networks.},

This article reviews the evidence that physician specialty training, the organization of physicians, and the method of physician payment are significant influences upon the utilization of health care services. Data from before the late 1980s raised the possibility that family practitioners employed fewer resources than general internists and that health maintenance organizations used fewer resources than solo practitioners. However, the studies from which these data were derived were marred by insufficient attention to patient mix, failure to account for interactions between specialty and system, and inadequate regard for the complexities of modern practice structures. More recent data from the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) overcomes some but not all of these problems. In general, it can be safely concluded that primary care specialty training, group practice, and prepaid care are associated with less utilization. Nevertheless, much more research is needed to address remaining methodological problems and to obtain data that are generalizable to the wide array of modern practice settings.},

The model is applied to the prescription drug market after patent expiration during the 80s, when the diffusion of generic drugs is fairly slow and consumer price sensitivity is known to be heterogeneous. I also introduce a new estimation approach to take the price endogeneity problem into account for this class of models. My approach is to estimate the demand model jointly with a pseudo-pricing policy function, which is a reduced-form function of observed and unobserved state variables. My estimation and counterfactual exercises demonstrate the value of estimating such a structural demand model, e.g., it allows one to learn whether consumers have optimistic or pessimistic prior, how aggregate learning affects the product diffusion rates in different latent segments of the population, and quantify the role of learning in explaining new product diffusion. I also find evidence that the brand-name price elasticities of demand (evaluated at the observed prices) are often less than one and increase over time, suggesting that brand-name firms might set their prices lower than what they would do if they were myopic, in order to slow down the learning process for generic qualities. But such an incentive might diminish over time as the uncertainty slowly resolves.},

The estimates indicate that the provider payment reform led to a 6.3\% increase in the targeted services provided to eligible beneficiaries, indicating an implied payment elasticity of 1.2. Further, the provider payment reform decreased the fraction of low-income beneficiaries with no primary care visit in a year by 9\%, completely closing the gap relative to higher-income beneficiaries with the same observable characteristics. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the payment increase led to an expansion of utilization for many subgroups, with somewhat larger effects among beneficiaries who are younger, are white, and live in areas with many primary care providers per capita.},

We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and the large (approximately {\textbackslash}13,500) jump in Medicare payments they receive when a patient's stay reaches a threshold number of days. Discharges increase substantially after the threshold, with the marginal discharged patient in relatively better health. Despite the large financial incentives and behavioral response in a high mortality population, we are unable to detect any compelling evidence of an impact on patient mortality. To assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules, we estimate a simple dynamic discrete choice model of LTCH discharge decisions. When we conservatively limit ourselves to alternative contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that an alternative contract can generate Medicare savings of about {\textbackslash}2,100 per admission, or about 5\% of total payments. More aggressive payment reforms can generate substantially greater savings, but the accompanying reduction in LTCH profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our results highlight how improved financial incentives may be able to reduce healthcare spending, without negative consequences for industry profits or patient health.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Objective  : Our objective was to understand the market characteristics related to closures of licensed pediatric hospital beds that may be related to increasing regionalization of pediatric hospital care.    Methods  : We performed a retrospective descriptive analysis of 110 hospitals with licensed pediatric hospital beds from a statewide survey of healthcare facilities (2012-2017) and administrative data of hospital admissions (2013-2018) in Illinois. We quantified closures of licensed pediatric hospital beds and categorized hospital bed closures by hospital and market characteristics.    Results  : From 2012 through 2017, the number of licensed pediatric beds declined from 1,706 to 1,254 (-26.5\%). Over the same time period, annual pediatric inpatient days minimally changed (+1.1\%), while annual pediatric inpatient days at hospitals affiliated with the Children's Hospital Association increased (+30.5\%). With some re-openings, the 33 hospitals that closed all licensed pediatric beds fit 4 distinct typologies: (1) Hospitals with minimal pediatric volume throughout the study (n=19); (2) Hospitals that sustained at least 50\% of their pediatric volume after closure of licensed pediatric beds (n=8); (3) Hospitals with low market share in metropolitan areas (n=5); and (4) Hospital with a decline in pediatric market share, while a nearby hospital saw a corresponding rise in pediatric market share (n=1).    Conclusions  : In Illinois, licensed pediatric hospital beds declined while pediatrics inpatient days stayed the same over a recent 6-year period. Typologies of closures describe the nuanced dynamics leading to decline of pediatric hospital beds. Understanding these patterns is critical to ensure that children receive quality pediatric-tailored care.    What's New   : We examined licensed pediatric hospital bed closures, and related market factors, in Illinois from 2012 to 2017. Licensed pediatric hospital beds declined while pediatric inpatient days remained the same. We identified four patterns of market dynamics related to closures.},

Integration may allow hospitals to share resources and management practices with their integrated physicians that increase the reported diagnostic severity of their patients.

We offer the first analysis of whether hospital-physician integration affects providers' coding of patient severity. Using a two-way fixed effects model, an event study, and a stacked difference-in-differences analysis of 5 million patient-year observations from 2010 to 2015, we find that the integration of a patient's primary care doctor is associated with a robust 2\%–4\% increase in coded severity, the risk-score equivalent of aging a physician's patients by 4–8 months. This effect was not driven by physicians treating different patients nor by physicians seeing patients more often. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that hospitals share organizational resources with acquired physician practices to increase the measured clinical severity of patients. Increases in the intensity of coding will improve vertically-integrated practices' performance in alternative payment models and pay-for-performance programs while raising overall health care spending.},

This study analyzes characteristics of all U.S. rural hospitals that closed between 1980 and 1986. Variables correlated with risk of closure for-profit ownership status, non-government not-for-profit ownership status, number of other hospitals in the county, presence of a nursing or other long-term care unit, few facilities and services offered, lack of accreditation by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Hospitals, lack of membership in a multihospital system - indicate that a rural hospital's survival depends upon its ability to compete and adapt in a volatile, competitive health care marketplace. Five policy options are discussed: changes in Medicare payments, expansion of the number of hospitals designated as Sole Community Hospitals, the use of swing beds, establishment of state offices of rural health, and short-term federal and state grants. Allowing hospitals the flexibility to adapt and compete, while ensuring adequate quality health care to rural residents, is suggested as the priority in rural health policy.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00497.x},
	abstract = {Hospitals are generally considered to be the locus of rural health care systems. Not only are important health services based at hospitals, but many of a community's health care personnel are either directly employed by or supported by the local hospital. Further, hospitals are often considered vital to local economies as they bring outside dollars into the communities via third-party payors, provide jobs, stimulate local purchasing, and help attract industry and retirees (Doeksen et al. 1997). As such, the closure of a hospital can have detrimental effects on a rural community. The rapid succession of hospital closures throughout the 1980s and 1990s helped stimulate legislation, such as creation of Critical Access Hospitals (hospitals that accept certain restrictions and are reimbursed 101 percent of cost from Medicare), designed to ensure the financial viability of small rural hospitals.

The number of small rural hospitals that have chosen to convert to CAH status has risen beyond expectations; as on August 2004, 959 small rural hospitals (over 40 percent of all rural hospitals) have opted out of Prospective Payment System by converting (Flex Monitoring Team 2005). In some policy circles, concern has been expressed about the effect on the Prospective Payment System of so many hospitals taking advantage of the protection of cost-based reimbursement (MEDPAC 2003). In light of these concerns, this is an opportune time to more accurately assess the economic importance of small rural hospitals to their communities, and to estimate the potential impact of their closure, should favorable reimbursement policies be changed.

The effect of hospital closures on the health of community members has been relatively well documented and is not the focus of this study. For example, Reif, Des Harnais, and Bernard (1999) study six communities experiencing a hospital closure and conclude that hospital closures decrease access to health care, whereas Rosenbach and Dayhoff (1995) find that per-capita Medicare expenditures grew at a slower rate in communities experiencing a closure. Fleming et al. (1995) find that residents of communities with a hospital closure experienced a mean increase in travel time to care of about 30 minutes. Rather, we are concerned with the relationship between a hospital closure and the local economic conditions before and after the closure. In general, hospital closure is perceived to have negative economic effects on a rural community (Hart, Pirani, and Rosenblatt 1991a), although few studies have directly measured the effect. A number of studies have attempted to estimate the role of hospitals in their local economies as evidence of the direct and indirect impact a closure would have, by either comparing the closure communities' economies to those of control groups, or through input/output (I/O) analysis.

In one of the earliest studies, Christianson and Faulkner modeled the contribution of rural hospitals to local economies and found an estimated \$686,405 to \$1,083,282 (US\$ in 1978) in community income was generated directly and indirectly by hospital expenditures; income multiplier estimates were less than 2 for 90 percent of the communities (Christianson and Faulkner 1981). McDermott et al. (1991) used hospital survey data to estimate the economic impact of a hospital on its host community and found that the combined induced and direct effects, on average, were \$54,739 per hospital bed (1991). Studies using I/O analysis, which uses observed data on business and consumer purchase patterns to estimate the direct and indirect/induced effects of a change in one sector of the economy on others, have found similar results. For example, Doeksen, Gerald, and Altobelli (1990) simulated the effect of a hospital closure in rural Oklahoma and estimated that over a 5-year period approximately 78 jobs, \$1.7 million in income, \$452,100 in retail sales, and \$9,100 in sales tax revenue would be lost because of the closure. Similar conclusions were reached using data from three Texas communities (Doeksen, Loewen, and Strawn 1990). Cordes et al. (1999) extended the literature by examining the role of the hospital in the economy and differentiating hospitals by bed size. They found that the estimated economic multipliers increased in magnitude with hospital bed size, but did not specifically estimate the effect of closure using I/O analysis.

While each of these studies suggests that a hospital closure would have negative economic consequences for rural communities, other research has indicated little to no effect on the rural community because of hospital closure. Pearson and Tajalli (2003) found that hospital closure does not appear to cause short- or long-term harm to the economies of their rural host communities. Their findings were based on a pretest/posttest model of data for 24 Texas rural communities where a hospital closed and a group of control communities. Five economic indicators were examined for trends and none were found to have had a statistically significant change following closure of the hospital. Similarly, Probst et al. (1999) compared economic indicators in closure communities to a control group of nonclosure communities and failed to find a statistically significant difference in income trends in the closure counties relative to the comparison counties. Stensland et al. (2002) examined the effect of 42 hospital closures in rural Appalachian communities and concluded that the closure had no effect on short-term or long-term economic growth of those areas.

Predominantly, the literature on the economic effects of hospital closures has relied on I/O analysis. Whereas I/O analysis has been useful in furthering the methodology of measuring hospital closure effects to include spending induced by the hospital business, the technique is limited in many ways. First, it is not designed to calculate “amenity” effects of a hospital closure—the absence of a local hospital may discourage retirees and businesses from moving into the community. Secondly, because of a lack of data on these small rural markets, I/O analysis for rural areas often relies on national purchasing trends, rather than local purchasing patterns, to calculate economic multipliers. Third, I/O treats the study region (often a county) as an isolated economy and tends to ignore market area considerations, which may lead to over- or under-estimation of the effects. Finally, I/O analysis does not offer measures of precision in the estimates. The concept of standard errors (SEs) is critical in ascertaining the degree of confidence one has in the results, and I/O has no such ability.

In this paper, we estimate the effect of hospital closure on the local economy using multivariate regression methods that do not require the use of a control group consisting of communities not experiencing a hospital closure. We posit that the closure of a hospital negatively affects the economic health of a community, and we extend the hospital closure literature in two new dimensions. First, we differentiate between the impact of a hospital closure in a community where another hospital remains open and closure in a community with no other proximal access to hospital services. This distinction is important because many of the ways that a closure can affect local economies, such as the amenity effect, can be mitigated by the presence of a near-by alternative hospital. Second, our analysis considers whether the economic conditions in communities where a hospital has closed can be attributed to the closure, or whether poor economic conditions preceded (and perhaps contributed to) the closure. Our methodology allows this assessment without the necessity of identifying appropriate controls, a difficult task as there may be intrinsic differences between financially struggling communities where hospitals ultimately close and those where they remain open.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Since 2010, the rate of rural hospital closures has increased significantly. This study is a preliminary look at recent closures and a formative step in research to understand the causes and the impact on rural communities.

Methods
The 2009 financial performance and market characteristics of rural hospitals that closed from 2010 through 2014 were compared to rural hospitals that remained open during the same period, stratified by critical access hospitals (CAHs) and other rural hospitals (ORHs). Differences were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and Wilcoxon rank test of medians. The relationships between negative operating margin and (1) market factors and (2) utilization/staffing factors were explored using logistic regression.

Findings
In 2009, CAHs that subsequently closed from 2010 through 2014 had, in general, lower levels of profitability, liquidity, equity, patient volume, and staffing. In addition, ORHs that closed had smaller market shares and operated in markets with smaller populations compared to ORHs that remained open. Odds of unprofitability were associated with both market and utilization factors. Although half of the closed hospitals ceased providing health services altogether, the remainder have since converted to an alternative health care delivery model.

Conclusions
Financial and market characteristics appear to be associated with closure of rural hospitals from 2010 through 2014, suggesting that it is possible to identify hospitals at risk of closure. As closure rates show no sign of abating, it is important to study the drivers of distress in rural hospitals, as well as the potential for alternative health care delivery models.},

We show that take-up of the new billing codes occurs gradually and exhibits substantial variation across space and across physician characteristics. Second, we provide evidence on how the new billing codes can both complement and substitute for the billing or provision of other services. We focus on two case studies. As a case of code substitution, we show that Transitional Care Management services partially crowd out traditional office visits following hospital discharges. As a case of code complementarity, we show that both Transitional Care Management and Chronic Care Management services predict increases in annual wellness visits. Overall, our analysis highlights how both new code take-up frictions and the impact of new code billing on existing code billing can be important for assessing the total costs and benefits of payment reforms.},

mental illnesses has evolved quite differently from the rest of health care sector. While medical care in general has seen major advances in the technology of treatment this has not been the case to the same extent for the 
treatment of mental illnesses. Relative to other illnesses, the cost of care for mental illnesses has grown more slowly and the social cost of illness has grown more rapidly. In this essay we offer evidence about the forces 
underpinning these patterns and emphasize the challenges stemming from the heterogeneity of mental illnesses. We examine institutions and rationing mechanisms that affect the ability to make appropriate matches between 
clinical problems and treatments. We conclude with a review of implications for policy and economic research.},

rationales for this transition. First, health insurance would boost fiscal revenues for healthcare, as post-treatment out-of-pocket payments to providers would be replaced by pre-treatment insurance premia to health ministries. 
Second, increased patient choice and carefully designed physician reimbursements would increase quality in the healthcare sector. Our essay shows that, at best, these objectives have only been partially met. Despite evidence 
that health insurance has provided financial protection, consumers are not willing to pay for unsubsidized premia. Health outcomes have not improved despite an increase in utilization. We argue that this is not because there 
was no room to improve the quality of care but because behavioral responses among healthcare providers have systematically undermined the objectives of these insurance schemes.},

	abstract = {Objective To test the effect of hospital-physician integration on primary care physicians' (PCP) clinical volume in traditional Medicare. Data Sources and Study Setting Nationwide retrospective longitudinal study using Medicare claims and other data sources from 2010 to 2016. Study Design We identified 70,000 PCPs, some of whom remained non-integrated and some who became hospital-integrated during this study period. We used an event study design to identify the effect of integration on key measures of physicians' clinical volume, including the number of claims, work-relative value units (RVUs), professional revenue generated, number of patients treated, and facility fee revenue generated. Principal Findings Per-physician clinical volume declined by statistically and economically significant margins. Relative to the comparison group who remained non-integrated, work RVUs fell by 7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: −8.6\% to −5.5\%); the number of patients treated fell by 4\% (95\% CI: −5.8\% to −2.6\%); and claims volume among PCPs who became hospital-integrated fell by over 15\% (95\% CI: −16.8\% to −13.5\%). Though professional revenue declined by {\textbackslash}29,165 (95\% CI: −{\textbackslash}32,286 to −{\textbackslash}26,044), this loss was almost entirely offset by increased facility fee revenue of {\textbackslash}28,556 (95\% CI: 26,909 to 30,203). Conclusions Hospital-physician integration may affect the quantity of clinical services delivered by PCPs to traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Reductions in clinical volume associated with integration may have long-term consequences for the supply of physician services and patient access to primary care. Future research on physician time use and patient access following hospital integration would further add to the evidence base.},

The goal is to perform statistical inference on the homophily parameters while treating the node-specific parameters as fixed effects. Jointly estimating all parameters leads to incidental-parameter bias and incorrect inference. As an alternative, we develop an approach based on a sufficient statistic that separates inference on the homophily parameters from estimation of the fixed effects. The estimator is easy to compute and can be applied to both dense and sparse networks, and is shown to have desirable asymptotic properties under sequences of growing networks. We illustrate the improvements of this estimator over maximum likelihood and bias-corrected estimation in a series of numerical experiments. The technique is applied to explain the import and export patterns in a dense network of countries and to estimate a more sparse advice network among attorneys in a corporate law firm.},

We propose a tractable method to address this problem by adding a congestion effect to standard discrete-choice models. We show analytically how this can improve forecasts of the consumer response to quality. We then apply this method to the market for heart surgery, and find that the attenuation bias in estimated quality effects can be important empirically.},

The Gini coefficient and the related concentration index embody one particular set of value judgements. By generalising these indices, alternative sets of value judgements can be reflected. The other issue addressed is how information on health inequality can be used together with information on the mean of the relevant distribution to obtain an overall measure of health “achievement”.},

	abstract = {Objective
Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent throughout the world, especially in the elderly population, and is strongly associated with patients’ frailty. However, little is known about the prevalence and treatment of OA in elderly patients in routine clinical care in Germany.

Materials and methods
As a part of Linking Patient-Reported Outcomes with CLAIms Data for Health Services Research in Rheumatology (PROCLAIR), a cross-sectional study using claims data from a large Germany statutory health insurance (BARMER) was conducted. We included people aged 60 years or older and assessed the prevalence of OA of the hip or knee, defined as having outpatient diagnoses (ICD: M16 or M17) in at least two quarters of 2014. The use of conservative treatment, including analgesics and physical therapy, and total joint replacement was studied. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, comorbidities, and level of care dependency defined by social law.

Results
A total of 595,754 patients (mean age: 74.9 years; 69.8\% female) were diagnosed with OA (21.8\%), with the highest prevalence in those between 80 and 89 years (31.0\%) and in females compared to males (23.9\% vs 18.3\%). Prevalence decreased with increasing level of care dependency from 30.5\% in patients with a low level (0/1) to 18.7\% in the highest level of care dependency. A total of 63.4\% of the patients with OA received analgesics, with higher use with increasing age. Physical therapy was prescribed to 43.1\% of the patients, but use decreased with age. In all, 5.3\% of the patients received total joint replacement in 2014.

Conclusion
The lower frequency of coded OA with increasing level of care dependency may reflect underdiagnosis, and patients with many other medical problems seem to be at risk for inadequate recognition and treatment of their OA.},

	abstract = {In a unified framework, we provide estimators and confidence bands for a variety of treatment effects when the outcome of interest, typically a duration, is subjected to right censoring. Our methodology accommodates average, distributional, and quantile treatment effects under different identifying assumptions including unconfoundedness, local treatment effects, and nonlinear differences-in-differences. The proposed estimators are easy to implement, have close-form representation, are fully data-driven upon estimation of nuisance parameters, and do not rely on parametric distributional assumptions, shape restrictions, or on restricting the potential treatment effect heterogeneity across different subpopulations. These treatment effects results are obtained as a consequence of more general results on two-step Kaplan-Meier estimators that are of independent interest: we provide conditions for applying (i) uniform law of large numbers, (ii) functional central limit theorems, and (iii) we prove the validity of the ordinary nonparametric bootstrap in a two-step estimation procedure where the outcome of interest may be randomly censored.},

Under a parallel trends assumption, the coefficient on each treatment identifies the sum of two terms. The first term is a weighted sum of the effect of that treatment in each group and period, with weights that may be negative and sum to one. The second term is a sum of the effects of the other treatments, with weights summing to zero. Accordingly, coefficients in those regressions are not robust to heterogeneous effects, and may be contaminated by the effect of other treatments. We propose alternative differences-in-differences estimators. To estimate, say, the effect of the first treatment, our estimators compare the outcome evolution of a group whose first treatment changes while its other treatments remain unchanged, to control groups whose treatments all remain unchanged, and with the same baseline treatments or treatments' history as the switching group. Those carefully selected comparisons are robust to heterogeneous effects, and do not suffer from the contamination problem.},

	abstract = {Background: Total hip and total knee arthroplasties are well accepted as reliable and suitable surgical procedures to return patients to function. Health-related quality-of-life instruments have been used to document outcomes in order to optimize the allocation of resources. The objective of this study was to review the literature regarding the outcomes of total hip and knee arthroplasties as evaluated by health-related quality-of-life instruments.
          Methods: The Medline and EMBASE medical literature databases were searched, from January 1980 to June 2003, to identify relevant studies. Studies were eligible for review if they met the following criteria: (1) the language was English or French, (2) at least one well-validated and self-reported health-related quality of life instrument was used, and (3) a prospective cohort study design was used.
          Results: Of the seventy-four studies selected for the review, thirty-two investigated both total hip and total knee arthroplasties, twenty-six focused on total hip arthroplasty, and sixteen focused on total knee arthroplasty exclusively. The most common diagnosis was osteoarthritis. The duration of follow-up ranged from seven days to seven years, with the majority of studies describing results at six to twelve months. The Short Form-36 and the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index, the most frequently used instruments, were employed in forty and twenty-eight studies, respectively. Seventeen studies used a utility index. Overall, total hip and total knee arthroplasties were found to be quite effective in terms of improvement in health-related quality-of-life dimensions, with the occasional exception of the social dimension. Age was not found to be an obstacle to effective surgery, and men seemed to benefit more from the intervention than did women. When improvement was found to be modest, the role of comorbidities was highlighted. Total hip arthroplasty appears to return patients to function to a greater extent than do knee procedures, and primary surgery offers greater improvement than does revision. Patients who had poorer preoperative health-related quality of life were more likely to experience greater improvement.
          Conclusions: Health-related quality-of-life data are valuable, can provide relevant health-status information to health professionals, and should be used as a rationale for the implementation of the most adequate standard of care. Additional knowledge and scientific dissemination of surgery outcomes should help to ensure better management of patients undergoing total hip or total knee arthroplasty and to optimize the use of these procedures.

This trade-off often results in decreased access to TAVR services by patients cared for in hospitals that cannot afford these services or have difficulty meeting procedural requirements, recruiting skilled physicians, and initiating and then maintaining a functioning TAVR program. The lack of access is more common among patients of color or those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.

We show that differential information about provider quality is an important determinant of this disparity. Our empirical strategy exploits the temporary presence of a website that publicly displayed summary star ratings of general practitioner (GP) offices in England. Regression discontinuity estimates show that patient demand responds sharply to the information on the website, and that this response is almost entirely driven by residents of low income neighborhoods. The results are consistent with high income patients having better private information about quality. We incorporate our estimates into a structural model of demand that allows for heterogeneity in information, preferences, and consumer inertia. We find that information differences explain 24 percent of the relationship between income and GP quality and reinforce disparities in access to care.},

The model allows for endogenous prices and instrumental variables, while avoiding parametric functional form assumptions about the unobserved components of utility. We use the approach to estimate bounds on the effects of changing premiums or subsidies on coverage choices, consumer surplus, and government spending on subsidies. We find that a {\textbackslash}10 decrease in monthly premium subsidies would cause a decline of between 1.8\% and 6.7\% in the proportion of subsidized adults with coverage. The reduction in total annual consumer surplus would be between {\textbackslash}62 and {\textbackslash}74 million, while the savings in yearly subsidy outlays would be between {\textbackslash}207 and \$602 million. We estimate the demand impacts of linking subsidies to age, finding that shifting subsidies from older to younger buyers would increase average consumer surplus, with potentially large impacts on enrollment. We also estimate the consumer surplus impact of removing the highly-subsidized plans in the Silver metal tier, where we find that a nonparametric model is consistent with a wide range of possibilities. We find that comparable mixed logit models tend to yield price sensitivity estimates toward the lower end of the nonparametric bounds, while producing consumer surplus impacts that can be both higher and lower than the nonparametric bounds depending on the specification of random coefficients.},

I discuss identification and estimation of a two-stage model of decision-making, with attention determined in the first stage, and choice among alternatives described in the second stage. The stages in this model are linked by unobservable factors and identified by available information specific to each.

Marketing Sci. 15(1):1–20]. We describe how subsequent work has extended their modeling framework and applied learning models to a wide range of different products and markets. We argue that learning models have contributed greatly to our understanding of consumer behavior—in particular, in enhancing our understanding of brand loyalty and long-run advertising effects. We also discuss the limitations of existing learning models and potential extensions. One key challenge is to disentangle learning as a source of dynamics from other key mechanisms that may generate choice dynamics (inventories, habit persistence, etc.). Another is to enhance identification of learning models by collecting and using direct measures of signals, perceptions, and expectations.},

Although both provider and patient behavior have been suggested as possible explanatory factors, the potential role of provider behavior has remained largely unexplored. Does provider behavior contribute to systematic inequities? If so, why? The purpose of this paper is to build on existing evidence to provide an integrated, coherent, and sound approach to future research on the provider contribution to race/ethnicity disparities in medical care. First, the existing evidence suggestive of a provider contribution to race/ethnicity variance in medical care is discussed. Second, a proposed causal model, based on a review of the social cognition and provider behavior literature, representing an integrated set of hypothesized mechanisms through which physician behavior may contribute to race/ethnicity disparities in care is presented.
CONCLUSION: There is sufficient evidence for the hypothesis that provider behavior contributes to race/ethnicity disparities in care to warrant further study. Although there is some evidence of support of the hypotheses that both provider beliefs about of patients and provider behavior during encounters are independently influenced by patient race/ethnicity further systematic rigorous study is needed and is proposed as a major immediate research priority. These mechanisms deserve intensive research focus as they may prove to be the most promising targets for interventions intended to ameliorate the provider contribution to disparities in care.},

Rural communities face unique health needs, necessitating access to local health care. Much has been written about the social, economic, legislative, and technological changes that have increased the stress on rural hospitals in the 1980s. However, quantifiable models have been lacking with which to examine in detail factors associated with rural hospitals and to correlate such factors with individual hospitals' risks of closing. In this study, we identify variables correlated with rural community hospital closures in the period 1980-87. Using epidemiologic case-control methods, 161 closed rural hospitals were matched 1 to 3 with a control group of 483 rural hospitals which remained open during the same period. A series of hospital performance indicators and demographic, economic, and social community variables were entered into a multiple logistic regression model. Four variables were found to be positively correlated with risk of closure. They are for-profit ownership; nongovernment, not-for-profit ownership; presence of a skilled nursing or other longterm care unit; and the number of other hospitals in the county. Variables negatively correlated with risk of closure were accreditation by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the number of facilities and services, and membership in a multihospital system.

We examined associations between social capital, and U.S. urban public hospital closures and conversions to private ownership from 1987 to 2007. We found that higher voting participation was associated with a greater hazard of public hospital closure over time (p {\textless} 0.01), whereas the number of business, professional and political organizations per 10,000 residents was associated a greater hazard of conversion (p {\textless} 0.05). Additional measures of bridging and linking social capital were not associated with either outcome. Taken together, our findings suggest that, at least historically, horizontal forms of social capital among more privileged groups (e.g., business, professional, and political associations) bear influence on public hospital outcomes. Specific efforts to increase engagement of disadvantaged groups and connect them with decision-makers may be needed to fully realize the potential of linking social capital to influence local healthcare policy promoting social protection.},

When a rural hospital closes, this is expected to reduce housing values, although no studies to date have investigated this relationship. As a pilot study for future research, we estimate the impact of White Community Medical Center’s (located in Carmi, Illinois) closure in December 2005 on local housing values, using a repeat sales estimator. We find that the change in housing values for houses that sold before and after the closure was not statistically significantly affected by the distance from the house to the closed hospital. These results are limited by a small number of repeat sales in White County; further research with data from other states is needed to determine the impact of rural hospital closures on housing values.},

Multiple regression analysis showed the proportion of inpatients who were nonwhite to be a strong predictor of hospital closure. The racial composition of the surrounding neighborhood was also a positive correlate of closure. Negative predictors included mean occupancy rate, the presence of social work services, and a variable representing the interaction of the racial composition of inpatient and neighborhood populations. In separate analyses, the proportion of inpatients with Medicaid coverage also emerged as a strong, independent correlate of closure.

This article examines factors related to hospital closures, using a longitudinal sample of surviving and closed hospitals. The hospitals are drawn from three states with different regulatory programs. Size of hospital and occupancy rate are shown to be related to likelihood of closure, while ownership, length of stay, and expenditures are not. These findings are observed both in the aggregate and within the individual states between 1960 and 1980. The three states--Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Maryland--represent different population trends and regulatory mechanisms and goals. The findings indicate that some programs appear to guarantee survival, whereas others are more neutral.},

Frontier hospitals play a key role in acute care, serve an important function in the recruitment and retention of physicians and health personnel, and contribute to the community's economic development. However, the local economy surrounding them may be inadequate to prevent socially undesirable facility closures. Present public policy, which is primarily based on a market approach, is incapable of addressing the problems faced by frontier hospitals. A reexamination of this does not mean that the only other option is to follow the patterns of highly regulated states such as Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut.

	abstract = {Safety net hospitals (SNHs) play a critical role in the U.S. health system (Hadley and Holahan 2003; Hadley et al. 2008). These hospitals either have a legal mandate to accept all patients or are private hospitals serving a disproportionate number of indigent individuals (Institute of Medicine, Committee on the Changing Market, Managed Care, and the Future Viability of Safety Net Providers 2000). SNHs are often located in neighborhoods where the poor and racial and ethnic minorities tend to reside, due to policy decisions to locate facilities in these areas or the locational choices of poor individuals (Gaskin and Hadley 1999; Hadley and Cunningham 2004).

The growing number of the uninsured has created an increased strain on the safety net, largely because it has been stagnant even as the demand for its services has grown (Marquis, Rogowski, and Escarce 2004; Cunningham, Bazzoli, and Katz 2008). Although most communities have stable safety nets (Felland et al. 2003), some have experienced SNH closure or ownership conversions where the expectation of community service is no longer present (e.g., conversion to for-profit status). These events could have a major impact on uninsured and poorly insured individuals who rely on these institutions.

The primary objective of our study was to examine changes in patterns of care within and across communities to assess how SNH closures or for-profit conversions affected disadvantaged individuals who lived near these events. Our difference-in-difference approach accounts not only for changes to local safety nets but also for changes to the overall hospital industry. From a policy perspective, our research is important given continuing public sector budget problems. The economic downturn has hurt state tax revenues, which could affect support for Medicaid and indigent health programs. Although U.S. health reform law may alleviate some issues, expansions of insurance coverage will not be implemented until 2014, and public agencies and SNHs will need to cope with growing numbers of uninsured in the interim.},

	doi = {10.5034/inquiryjrnl_40.1.39},
	abstract = {This study assesses the determinants of conversions in hospital ownership from 1986 through 1996. To place such changes in context, we also analyze causes of hospital mergers and closures, which are often alternatives to hospital ownership conversion. A consistent result from our analysis is that an important antecedent of ownership conversions is a low profit margin. Conversions from private nonprofit or government ownership to for-profit status are preceded by chronically low margins and high debt-to-asset ratios. By contrast, conversions from for-profit ownership occur quickly following declines in margins. Many mergers seem motivated by a desire to increase market power—a consideration not evident for conversions. The U.S. hospital industry experienced a major downsizing during the last two decades of the 20th century, gauged in terms of both the number of hospitals and the number of hospital beds. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of hospitals declined by 17\% and the number of hospital beds by 28\%; most of the decline occurred from 1986 to 1996, the period under study in this paper (National Center for Health Statistics 1998, 2002). The decreases in hospitals and hospital beds reflect a virtual halt in hospital entry, coupled with a substantial number of exits and mergers. At the same time, the composition of hospitals by ownership form has changed, with public hospitals losing and private for-profit hospitals gaining market share (American Hospital Association 2001). Changes in the composition of hospital ownership accompany sales of hospitals and reflect differential rates of exit by ownership form. Among the major forces underlying these trends appear to be increased competition in the product markets in which hospitals operate, and a related change—a switch from paying hospitals for inpatient care on a retrospective cost basis to paying via various forms of prospective payment. Also important is technological change enabling the substitution of outpatient care for inpatient care. To a certain extent, such technological change was a response to the changes in payment practices for inpatient care. Interestingly, although there is widespread consensus about the factors responsible for the trends in organization of the hospital industry, there is a paucity of empirical studies documenting the underlying relationships.},

	abstract = {Between 1997 and 2005, 9 of 19 obstetric units in Philadelphia County closed, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in the number of obstetric beds (Maternity Care Coalition 2005). The literature on the reduction in hospital services largely studies potential reasons for hospital closures. These studies suggest that closures occur in highly competitive health care markets (Lee and Alexander 1999; Mullner et al. 1989), and the hospitals most at-risk for closing were smaller and for profit (Buchmueller, Jacobson, and Wold 2006; Ciliberto and Lindrooth 2007; Deily, McKay, and Dorner 2000; Lillie-Blanton et al. 1992; Lindrooth, Lo Sasso, and Bazzoli 2003). In Philadelphia, primary data suggest that increased fixed costs over the postclosure period, primarily increased malpractice premiums (Anonymous 2007; Burling 2007; George 2001, 2002, 2005, 2008a, 2009; McCullough 2003; Treaster 2002) and reduced reimbursement for obstetric care (Burling 2007; George 2008a,b, 2009; McCullough 2003) were the primary reason for closures. Most investigations into the effect of hospital closures are limited to the closure of rural hospitals (Rosenbach and Dayhoff 1995) or single hospitals within a large metropolitan area. These studies show conflicting results on the impact of hospital closures on patient outcomes. Even though obstetric units are the units most commonly eliminated by individual hospitals when reducing services (Kirby et al. 2006), the effects of a large urban obstetric service reduction on perinatal outcomes have not been systematically examined in the literature.

The goal of this study was to determine the effect of a large-scale reduction in obstetric bed supply on maternal and neonatal outcomes, using a before-and-after study design with an untreated control group to control for secular trends and changes in patient characteristics. Based on prior literature, we hypothesized that some outcomes, such as neonatal mortality, neonatal complications, and maternal complications would worsen as more units closed. These outcomes are most likely to change with changes in either access of hospital care or the timeliness of care delivery. Other outcomes, such as the delivery of infants between 23 and 32 weeks gestation, would not change because multiple studies suggest that medical management cannot reduce the risk of a delivery under 32 weeks gestation by mothers in premature labor (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2003), and thus timeliness of care may not affect these outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Study Hypothesis  Low reimbursement from the uninsured has been claimed to threaten hospital finances and even hospital emergency department (ED) closure. We hypothesized in advance of beginning data collection that states that expanded Medicaid (“expansion states”) under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would experience a reduced rate of ED closure compared with states that did not.    Methods  We compiled a national census of EDs from 2006 through 2013 from federal databases and manually confirmed each closure. We used difference-in-differences regression on this longitudinal panel to compare the probability over time that a hospital was in operation in expansion states to nonexpansion states.    Results  The number of hospitals grew every year nationally and in nonexpansion states. In expansion states, the number fell from 2027 in 2009 to 2019 in 2010, not surpassing the 2009 peak until 2012. In regression estimates, hospitals in expansion states were 2.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.3\%-4.1\%) less likely to be in operation after 2010 compared with the trend in nonexpansion states.    Conclusions  States that expanded Medicaid experienced increased, rather than reduced, ED closure rates from 2010 through 2013.

To understand hospital- and county-level factors for rural obstetric unit closures, using mixed methods.

Data Sources
Hospital discharge data from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Statewide Inpatient Databases, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and Area Resource File for 2010, as well as 2013–2014 telephone interviews of all 306 rural hospitals in nine states with at least 10 births in 2010. Via interview, we ascertained obstetric unit status, reasons for closures, and postclosure community capacity for prenatal care.

Study Design
Multivariate logistic regression and qualitative analysis were used to identify factors associated with unit closures between 2010 and 2014.

Principal Findings
Exactly 7.2 percent of rural hospitals in the study closed their obstetric units. These units were smaller in size, more likely to be privately owned, and located in communities with lower family income, fewer obstetricians, and fewer family physicians. Prenatal care was still available in 17 of 19 communities, but local women would need to travel an average of 29 additional miles to access intrapartum care.

Conclusions
Rural obstetric unit closures are more common in smaller hospitals and communities with a limited obstetric workforce. Concerns about continuity of rural maternity care arise for women with local prenatal care but distant intrapartum care.},

This association persisted whether we considered ED closures as affecting all future nearby admissions or only those occurring in the subsequent two years.

	doi = {10.1097/mlr.0b013e31819c9415},
	abstract = {Emergency departments and trauma centers are key players of the health care safety net for all patients, especially the underserved. Trauma centers, in particular, have been shown to significantly reduce both morbidity and mortality in numerous studies, and are important public health institutions given that injury is the most important cause of lost years of life in the United States.1–5 Trauma centers, however, are not without costs; they have traditionally been viewed as unprofitable, and have been shown to serve higher proportions of Medicaid and uninsured patients compared with nontrauma centers and sustain greater losses for the care they provide.6,7 Specific concerns have been voiced by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other stakeholders regarding the underfunding of and uneven access to trauma centers, which are seen as particularly vulnerable to closure because of the high costs of care.7–11

One of the areas that has been relatively unexplored in trauma service studies is the identification of system-level risk factors of trauma center closures. Although there are, on average, an increasing number of trauma centers in the United States, the pattern of openings and closures has been very unstable. One of the few studies looking at closures in the past decade found approximately 60 trauma centers dropped their trauma designation from 1981 to 1991.12 The rate of closures has accelerated, with over 300 trauma centers closing in urban areas between 1990 and 2005.

Current literature in this field is mainly descriptive data on the trends and characteristics of trauma centers.6,10,11,12–19 Although some works document the financial characteristics of trauma centers,6,12,13,18,20–22 to our knowledge, no study has conducted multivariate analysis examining the institutional risk factors of trauma center closures.

Alongside financial considerations, however, it is also important to identify if these exits occur differentially in areas with higher shares of vulnerable populations (eg, poor, minority, uninsured) requiring this service. Although there are some outcomes-based studies documenting racial disparities in trauma care on a patient-level,23–26 no study investigates whether there is a differential closure rate of trauma centers among areas with varying shares of vulnerable populations.

In this study, we aim to extend the work of this field by conducting a multivariate analysis of trauma center closures that occurred between 1990 and 2005. Specifically, we estimate the hazard rates of shutting down these trauma centers along several dimensions of risk factors, particularly: (1) whether financial pressure increases the risks of trauma center closure, holding other characteristics constant; and (2) whether vulnerable populations (such as minority or poor population) are more likely to be in areas with higher risks of trauma center closures.},

This acceleration in closures raised a number of concerns over current payment policies and their impact on access. This paper investigates hospital closures that occurred in 1985 through 1988. A hospital's financial status and mission or community standing were found to be determinants of hospital closure. Closed hospitals are much less likely to be publicly owned but more likely to offer fewer facilities and services, and have fewer cases. This may suggest that the patients directly affected by the closure can be absorbed by other hospitals or other nonhospital providers. Profitability is associated with the Medicare case-mix index and the share of Medicare patients. The findings also suggest that the case mix index may be rewarding some small hospitals in excess of the costs attributable to case-mix. For both urban and rural hospitals, a low share of Medicare patients increased the risk of hospital closure, independently of the relationship between Medicare share and profit. The share of Medicare patients also affected closure indirectly, through its effects on profit. Competition appears to affect the odds of closure through its effects on the number of cases. In addition, hospitals in areas with small or declining population are more at risk than other hospitals in both urban and rural areas.},

In the second equation, healthcare expenditures is the dependent variable, and hospital bed supply and certificate of need are included as independent variables. RESULTS: Certificate-of-need laws have reduced the number of hospital beds by about 10\% and have reduced healthcare expenditures by almost 2\%. Certificate-of-need programs did not have a direct effect on healthcare expenditures. CONCLUSION: Certificate-of-need programs have limited the growth in the supply of hospital beds, and this has led to a slight reduction in the growth of healthcare expenditures.},

	abstract = {Treatment for depression is complex, requiring decisions that may involve trade-offs between exploiting treatments with the highest expected value and experimenting with treatments with higher possible payoffs. Using patient claims data, we show that among skilled doctors, using a broader portfolio of drugs predicts better patient outcomes, except in cases where doctors' decisions violate loose professional guidelines. We introduce a behavioral model of decision making guided by our empirical observations. The model's novel feature is that the trade-off between exploitation and experimentation depends on the doctor's diagnostic skill. The model predicts that higher diagnostic skill leads to greater diversity in drug choice and better matching of drugs to patients even among doctors with the same initial beliefs regarding drug effectiveness. Consistent with the finding that guideline violations predict poorer patient outcomes, simulations of the model suggest that increasing the number of possible drug choices can lower performance.},

Though there is much work on learning in more general systems, it is useful here to focus on models with these specifications since more general systems can be approximated in this way and since much of the early work on learning has been done with these quadratic-linear-gaussian systems. We begin with what has been learned about learning in dynamic economic models in the last few decades. Then we progress to a discussion of what we hope to learn in the future from a new project that is just getting underway. However before doing either of these we provide a short description of the mathematical framework that will be used in the chapter.},

We show that within hospitals and years, patients with more aggressive providers have consistently higher costs and better outcomes. Since all patients benefit from higher utilization of invasive procedures, targeting procedure use to the most appropriate patients benefits these patients at the expense of the less appropriate patients. We also find that the most aggressive and responsive physicians are young, male, and trained in top 20 schools.},

	abstract = {Many large and small decisions we make in our daily lives—which ice cream to choose, what research projects to pursue, which partner to marry—require an exploration of alternatives before committing to and exploiting the benefits of a particular choice. Furthermore, many decisions require re-evaluation, and further exploration of alternatives, in the face of changing needs or circumstances. That is, often our decisions depend on a higher level choice: whether to exploit well known but possibly suboptimal alternatives or to explore risky but potentially more profitable ones. How adaptive agents choose between exploitation and exploration remains an important and open question that has received relatively limited attention in the behavioural and brain sciences. The choice could depend on a number of factors, including the familiarity of the environment, how quickly the environment is likely to change and the relative value of exploiting known sources of reward versus the cost of reducing uncertainty through exploration. There is no known generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem, and a solution to the general case may indeed not be possible. However, there have been formal analyses of the optimal policy under constrained circumstances. There have also been specific suggestions of how humans and animals may respond to this problem under particular experimental conditions as well as proposals about the brain mechanisms involved. Here, we provide a brief review of this work, discuss how exploration and exploitation may be mediated in the brain and highlight some promising future directions for research.},

Previous studies sought to explain variations in technology adoption by heterogeneity in profitability, costs of adoption, or other factors. Less is known about how adoption is affected by bias in the perceived skill to implement the technology. We develop a Bayesian framework in which the use of the technology depends on perceived skill, while the outcomes from using it depend on actual skill. We study the determinants of adoption in the case of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) for which we document large differences across hospitals in the rate of adoption between 2002-2006, and a strong reversal from 2006-2013. We find that perception bias explains two-thirds of the cross-hospital variation in ICD use. A dynamic version of the model with learning about bias predicts accurately the subsequent decline in ICD use between 2006-2013. These results suggest an important role for misperception in explaining the wide variation in the adoption of new technologies.},

Taking the example of antidepressant drugs, we use French panel data on exhaustive prescriptions made by a representative sample of general practitioners to more than 110,000 depressed patients between 2000 and 2008. New results revealing an increase in suicidal thinking among children taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were reported in 2004 and prompted the release of new guidelines by public health authorities. We identify the effect of this unexpected warning on physicians’ drug choices while addressing the possibility that patients heterogeneity may be correlated with unobserved physician characteristics. While the warning decreased the average probability of prescribing SSRIs, we find that physicians’ responses to the warning were very heterogeneous and larger if the physician had a higher preference for prescribing SSRIs before the warning.},

	abstract = {Importance  Increasing use of robotic surgery for common surgical procedures with limited evidence and unclear clinical benefit is raising concern. Analyses of population-based trends in practice and how hospitals’ acquisition of robotic surgical technologies is associated with their use are limited.  Objective  To characterize trends in the use of robotic surgery for common surgical procedures.  Design, Setting, and Participants  This cohort study used clinical registry data from Michigan from January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2018. Trends were characterized in the use of robotic surgery for common procedures for which traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery was already considered a safe and effective approach for most surgeons when clinically feasible. A multigroup interrupted time series analysis was performed to determine how procedural approaches (open, laparoscopic, and robotic) change after hospitals launch a robotic surgery program. Data were analyzed from March 1 through April 19, 2019.  Exposures  Initiation of robotic surgery.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Procedure approach (ie, robotic, open, or laparoscopic).  Results  The study cohort included 169404 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [16.9] years; 90595 women [53.5\%]) at 73 hospitals. The use of robotic surgery increased from 1.8\% in 2012 to 15.1\% in 2018 (8.4-fold increase; slope, 2.1\% per year; 95\% CI, 1.9\%-2.3\%). For certain procedures, the magnitude of the increase was greater; for example, for inguinal hernia repair, the use of robotic surgery increased from 0.7\% to 28.8\% (41.1-fold change; slope, 5.4\% per year; 95\% CI, 5.1\%-5.7\%). The use of robotic surgery increased 8.8\% in the first 4 years after hospitals began performing robotic surgery (2.8\% per year; 95\% CI, 2.7\%-2.9\%). This trend was associated with a decrease in laparoscopic surgery from 53.2\% to 51.3\% (difference, −1.9\%; 95\% CI, −2.2\% to −1.6\%). Before adopting robotic surgery, hospitals’ use of laparoscopic surgery increased 1.3\% per year. After adopting robotic surgery, the use of laparoscopic surgery declined 0.3\% (difference in trends, −1.6\%; 95\% CI, −1.7\% to −1.5\%).  Conclusions and Relevance  These results suggest that robotic surgery has continued to diffuse across a broad range of common surgical procedures. Hospitals that launched robotic surgery programs had a broad and immediate increase in the use of robotic surgery, which was associated with a decrease in traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.},

Observers of this phenomena have invoked "flat of the curve medicine" to explain these facts, and have advocated for reductions in spending in high-use areas. In contrast, we develop a simple Roy model of patient treatment choice with productivity spillovers that can generate the empirical facts. Our model predicts that high-use areas will have higher returns to surgery, better outcomes among patients most appropriate for surgery, and worse outcomes among patients least appropriate for surgery, while displaying no relationship between treatment intensity and overall outcomes. Using data on treatments for heart attacks, we find strong empirical support for these and other predictions of our model, and reject alternative explanations such as waste or supplier induced demand, for geographic variation in medical care.},

	abstract = {In the United States, health care technology has contributed to rising survival rates, yet health care spending relative to GDP has also grown more rapidly than in any other country. We develop a model of patient demand and supplier behavior to explain these parallel trends in technology growth and cost growth. We show that health care productivity depends on the heterogeneity of treatment effects across patients, the shape of the health production function, and the cost structure of procedures such as MRIs with high fixed costs and low marginal costs. The model implies a typology of medical technology productivity: (I) highly cost-effective
"home run" innovations with little chance of overuse, such as anti-retroviral therapy for HIV, (II) treatments highly effective for some but not for all (e.g., stents), and (III) "gray area" treatments with uncertain clinical value such as ICU days among chronically ill patients. Not surprisingly, countries adopting Category I and effective Category II treatments gain the greatest health improvements, while countries adopting ineffective Category II and Category III treatments experience the most rapid cost growth. Ultimately, economic and political resistance in the
United States to ever-rising tax rates will likely slow cost growth, with uncertain effects on technology growth. (JEL H51, I11, I18, O31)},

We apply a multi-equation model in the LISREL format, with GP quality and patient health as latent determinants of demand for GP services. Patient excess mortality rate at the GP level is one indicator of quality.

Data Source Medicare Part A and Part B claim (2008–2012) for all beneficiaries residing in any of 17 market areas: the Provider of Service file, the Healthcare Cost Report Information System, and the Dartmouth Atlas. Study Design An observational study in which hospitals were distinguished according to PAC referral concentration, which is the tendency to utilize fewer rather than more PAC providers. We tested the hypothesis that higher referral concentration would be associated with total Medicare bundled payments. Data Collection/Extraction Methods The data represent a convenience sample of market areas that were defined by the locations of grantees from the ONC Beacon Community Program. Principal Findings The four most-used PAC providers accounted for an average of 60 percent of patients discharged from hospitals in the sample. Regression analysis suggested that higher referral concentration was associated with lower Medicare costs per bundle. Conclusions Hospitals that tend to use fewer PAC providers may lead to lower costs for payers such as Medicare. The study results reinforce the importance of limited networks for PAC services under bundling arrangements for hospital and PAC payments.},

	abstract = {We examine the teams that emerge when a primary care physician (PCP) refers patients to specialists. When PCPs concentrate their specialist referrals—for instance, by sending their cardiology patients to fewer distinct cardiologists—repeat interactions between PCPs and specialists are encouraged. Repeated interactions provide more opportunities and incentives to develop productive team relationships. Using data from the Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database, we construct a new measure of PCP team referral concentration and document that it varies widely across PCPs, even among PCPs in the same organization. Chronically ill patients treated by PCPs with a one standard deviation higher team referral concentration have 4\% lower healthcare utilization on average, with no discernible reduction in quality. We corroborate this finding using a national sample of Medicare claims and show that it holds under various identification strategies that account for observed and unobserved patient and physician characteristics. The results suggest that repeated PCP-specialist interactions improve team performance.

	abstract = {Economists have devoted considerable attention to the question of whether market transactions, contracts, and/or regulation can generate efficient outcomes. The chapter presents a discussion on efficient outcomes for health care services markets. The chapter begins with an analysis of whether health care markets are “different” from textbook markets. Arrow argues that the conditions facilitating an “optimal state” are often missing in health care. This chapter discusses and examines these conditions and pays particular attention to asymmetric information about quality. The chapter also reviews the empirical evidence on the performance of competitive health care markets. At one time the conventional wisdom was that competition led to higher prices, an idea captured by the theory of the Medical Arms Race. With the growth of selective contracting between providers and payers, competition is now associated with lower prices. The chapter also discusses regulatory approaches to containing prices. Theory suggests that a mixed payment scheme combining a fixed “prepayment” with partial cost sharing should outperform either pure prepayment or pure cost-based payment. The chapter also includes another quality assurance mechanism—third party certification embodied by health care report cards. Despite widely cited unanticipated and undesirable consequences, report cards for health insurers and providers seem to offer several benefits: they move market share away from the worst sellers, encourage all sellers to improve quality, and facilitate matching between severely ill patients and the best providers. The chapter also explores pay for performance schemes, which combine elements of incentive contracts and quality certification.},

The U.S. health care system includes several compensatory cost-containment mechanisms, but their effects depend on how patients and providers respond. We investigate hospice programs’ responses to a cap in the Medicare hospice benefit on their average annual payments per patient. We estimate their intensive margin responses to the cap by leveraging variation in cap-related financial incentives generated by the policy’s nonlinear design and the transition between fiscal years. We find that programs on track to exceed the cap in the last three months of a fiscal year raise their enrollment rates by 5.7\% and their live discharge rates by 4.3\% on average, reducing their cap liabilities. The marginal enrollees have longer average remaining lifetimes and are less likely to have been recently hospitalized. Their hospice spells are also more likely to be fragmented by subsequent live discharges. On the extensive margin, we find that cap liabilities are associated with terminations of Medicare provider certification numbers, suggesting that the cap impacts market structure. Current policy discussions about reducing the cap should consider its potential effect on market structure.},

	abstract = {There are widespread differences in total factor productivity across producers in the U.S. and around the world. To help explain these variations, we devise a general test for misallocation in input choices – the underuse of effective inputs and overuse of ineffective ones. Misallocation implies that conditional on total input use, the return to using a particular input is not zero (a positive return implies underuse, and a negative return implies overuse). We measure misallocation across hospitals, where inputs and outputs are better measured than in other industries. Applying our test to a sample of 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries with heart attacks (of which 436 thousand were admitted by ambulance), we reject the hypothesis of productive efficiency; moving a patient from a 10th percentile to a 90th percentile hospital with respect to misallocation, holding spending constant, is predicted to increase survival by 3.1 percentage points. With misallocation accounting for as much as 25 percent of the variation in hospital productivity, our results suggest that how the money is spent, rather than how much money is spent, is central to understanding productivity differences both in health care, and in the rest of the economy.},

It was believed that this program would reduce the rate of rural hospital closures and improve access to health care services in rural communities.



Objective: The objective of this paper is to analyze the economic impact of the CAH Program on Kentucky's communities.



Methods: Both an economic input-output model and a quasi-experimental control group method are used in this research paper. While the analysis using the input-output model uses data from the year 2006, the analysis using the quasi-experimental control group method uses data from 1989 to 2006.



Conclusion: The results indicate that the rural counties where a CAH was adopted did appear to benefit in economic terms relative to those that did not have a CAH.},

	abstract = {Abstract Context Surgical volume is correlated with increased hospital profitability, yet many Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) offer few or no inpatient surgical services. Objectives This study aims to investigate the impact of the presence of different inpatient surgical services on CAH profitability. Methods The study design was a cross-sectional analysis of financial data from the most recent fiscal year (FY) of 1299 CAHs. Multiple linear regression was utilized to assess how the operating margin was affected by the number of different inpatient surgical services offered per hospital. Covariates known to be associated with hospital profitability included occupancy rate, case mix index (CMI), system affiliation, ownership status (public, private, or nonprofit), and geographic region. Results The regression model for the CAH operating margin returned an R 2 value of 0.18. Each additional inpatient surgical service corresponded to a 1.5\% increase in operating margin (p=0.0413). Each 10\% increase in occupancy rate and 0.1 increase in CMI corresponded to a 0.9\% increase in operating margin (p=0.0032 and p=0.0176, respectively). The number of surgical services offered per CAH showed positive correlations with occupancy rate (r=0.23, p\&lt;0.0001) and CMI (r=0.59, p\&lt;0.0001). Conclusions A positive correlation exists between operating margin and the diversity of inpatient surgical specialties available at CAHs. Furthermore, providing surgery allows CAHs to accommodate higher occupancy rates and case mixes, both of which are significantly and positively correlated with CAH operating margin.},

Nor did we see evidence of statistically significant differential improvement at critical access hospitals in expansion versus nonexpansion states on either staffing measures (physicians and registered nurses per 1,000 patient days) or quality measures (percentage-point changes in readmissions and mortality within thirty days of admission for pneumonia or heart failure).

Objective To compare 30-day outcomes after rural vs urban ED visits and in CAHs, a subset of rural hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants This propensity-matched, retrospective cohort study used a 20\% sample of national Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from January 1, 2011, to October 31, 2015. Rural and urban ED visits were matched on demographics, patient prior use of EDs, comorbidities, and diagnoses. Thirty-day outcomes overall and stratified by 25 common ED diagnoses were evaluated, with similar analysis of CAHs vs non-CAHs. Data were analyzed from February 15, 2020, to May 17, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were ED revisits with and without hospitalization. Results The matched cohort included 473152 rural and urban Medicare beneficiaries with a mean (SD) age of 75.1 (7.9) years (59.1\% and 59.3\% women, respectively; 86.9\% and 87.1\% White, respectively). Medicare beneficiaries at rural vs urban EDs experienced similar all-cause 30-day mortality (3.9\% vs 4.1\%; effect size, 0.01), ED revisits (18.1\% vs 17.8\%; effect size, 0.00), and ED revisits with hospitalization (6.0\% vs 8.1\%; effect size, 0.00). Rural ED visits were associated with more transfer (6.2\% vs 2.0\%; effect size, 0.22) and fewer hospitalizations (24.7\% vs 39.2; effect size, 0.31). Stratified by diagnosis, patients in rural EDs with life-threatening illnesses experienced more transfer with 30-day mortality similar to that of patients in urban EDs. In contrast, mortality differed for patients in rural EDs with symptom-based diagnoses, including chest pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.54 [95\% CI, 1.25-1.89]), nausea and vomiting (OR, 1.68 [95\% CI, 1.26-2.24), and abdominal pain (OR, 1.73 [95\% CI, 1.42-2.10]). All findings were similar for CAHs. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study of rural ED care suggest that patient mortality for potentially life-threatening conditions is comparable to that in urban settings. Further research is needed to understand the sources of greater rural ED mortality for symptom-based conditions. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring access to treatment of life-threatening conditions at local EDs in rural communities, which are increasingly endangered by hospital closures.},

Results: Characteristicscorrelated with reduced hospital readmission rates and reimbursement penalties included hospitals (1) with critical access status; (2) located in counties with a better county health rank; and (3) located in a primary care shortage area that utilized house calls.
Discussion: Implications include supporting policies that increase access to services, improve formulas for reimbursement, and encourage innovation in care delivery models. Future research efforts should focus on house calls in primary care shortage areas.

We evaluate the validity of commonly used quality indicators, such as mortality, readmissions, inpatient costs, and length-of-stay, using a quasi-experimental design where hospital closures reallocate large numbers of patients to hospitals of different quality. This setting allows us to measure whether patient outcomes improve as much as quality indicators predict when a relatively low-quality hospital closes, or decline as predicted when a relatively high-quality hospital closes. Using more than 20 years of Medicare claims for over 30 million patients admitted with five common diagnoses, we find that hospital quality indicators overstate differences in the causal impact of hospitals on mortality and readmission rates by 7 percent or less, but overstate differences in the causal impact of hospitals on inpatient cost and length-of-stay measures by closer to 40 percent. On average, hospital closures reduce patient mortality by shifting patients to higher quality hospitals, but the but the effect varies widely depending on the relative quality of the closing hospital.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The increasing cost of prescription drugs in the United States has become a source of concern for patients, prescribers, payers, and policy makers.
OBJECTIVES: To review the origins and effects of high drug prices in the US market and to consider policy options that could contain the cost of prescription drugs.
EVIDENCE: We reviewed the peer-reviewed medical and health policy literature from January 2005 to July 2016 for articles addressing the sources of drug prices in the United States, the justifications and consequences of high prices, and possible solutions.
FINDINGS: Per capita prescription drug spending in the United States exceeds that in all other countries, largely driven by brand-name drug prices that have been increasing in recent years at rates far beyond the consumer price index. In 2013, per capita spending on prescription drugs was \$858 compared with an average of \$400 for 19 other industrialized nations. In the United States, prescription medications now comprise an estimated 17\% of overall personal health care services. The most important factor that allows manufacturers to set high drug prices is market exclusivity, protected by monopoly rights awarded upon Food and Drug Administration approval and by patents. The availability of generic drugs after this exclusivity period is the main means of reducing prices in the United States, but access to them may be delayed by numerous business and legal strategies. The primary counterweight against excessive pricing during market exclusivity is the negotiating power of the payer, which is currently constrained by several factors, including the requirement that most government drug payment plans cover nearly all products. Another key contributor to drug spending is physician prescribing choices when comparable alternatives are available at different costs. Although prices are often justified by the high cost of drug development, there is no evidence of an association between research and development costs and prices; rather, prescription drugs are priced in the United States primarily on the basis of what the market will bear.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: High drug prices are the result of the approach the United States has taken to granting government-protected monopolies to drug manufacturers, combined with coverage requirements imposed on government-funded drug benefits. The most realistic short-term strategies to address high prices include enforcing more stringent requirements for the award and extension of exclusivity rights; enhancing competition by ensuring timely generic drug availability; providing greater opportunities for meaningful price negotiation by governmental payers; generating more evidence about comparative cost-effectiveness of therapeutic alternatives; and more effectively educating patients, prescribers, payers, and policy makers about these choices.},

	abstract = {In his Labor Day address, President Biden stated that the U.S. “has the highest drug prices in the world, and there is no reason for it.” For new branded drugs, the first part of that statement is supported by a recent RAND Report (Mulcahy et. al. 2021) which found U.S. average prices are 2.3 times those present in both the 32 OECD countries overall and in the UK separately. In this research, we consider the second part of that statement, and identify the economic factors that suggest some “reasons for it.” Viewing pharmaceutical markets through the lens of the theories of global public goods and alliances, as developed by Olson and Zeckhauser (1966), we explain the observed pricing differences along with their implications the for the global supply of innovative new drugs. Similar views were advanced in two U.S. government reports (CEA 2018, 2020), and also by Goldman and Lakdawala (2018). We develop these ideas further and implement them empirically. A commonly held theory presumes that drug companies in the U.S set prices for patented drugs at profit- maximizing levels that fund and incentivize substantial research and development efforts. In contrast, in the rest of the world (ROW), national authorities set prices minimally above marginal costs of production, allowing few revenues remaining to support R\&D (CEA Report 2018; Blumenthal 2018; Hooper and Henderson 2022). The ROW countries are then considered to be fully free riding on U.S. research efforts. We examine this argument both theoretically and empirically, and find it wanting. We apply global public good theory to examine the pricing of branded drugs. To this end, we describe the optimal global contribution, as supported by the Lindahl pricing model, and show theoretically that existing independently determined contributions and thereby aggregate R\&D levels are likely sub-optimal. Then we implement the model by calculating the contribution to the global public good as represented by short-term profits or quasi-rents received from sales of all branded drugs. These calculations are derived from pricing data contained in the RAND Report along with two market-based estimates of marginal costs. We find that, while ROW contributions are less than those found in the United States, they are more than minimal, and do not approach zero for most countries. When we regress these positive contributions on a country’s size of GDP along with various controls, we find that GDP size alone is a powerful determinant of national contributions. It remains economically and statistically significant without regard to the controls introduced. In addition, we estimate how large are the contributions of ROW countries to the global public good. We offer reasons why US pharmaceutical prices and contributions per capita are nevertheless higher than those found in all ROW countries. We also suggest actions aimed to promote R\&D efforts that are closer to the global optimum.},

Theory suggests that additional insured consumers will raise the optimal price of a branded drug, while the insurer's ability to move demand to substitute treatments may lower prices. We estimate the program's effect on the price and utilization of pharmaceutical treatments. We find that Part D enrollees paid substantially lower prices than while uninsured, and increased their utilization of prescription drugs. We find relative price declines only for drugs with significant therapeutic competition.  (L18, L11, L65)},

	abstract = {During the 1980s the share of prescriptions sold by retail pharmacies that was accounted for by generic products roughly doubled. The price response to generic entry of brand-name products has been a source of controversy. In this paper we estimate models of price responses to generic entry in the market for brand-name and generic drugs. We study a sample of 32 drugs that lost patent protection during the early to mid-1980s. Our results provide evidence that brand-name prices increase after generic entry and are accompanied by large decreases in the price of generic drugs.},
