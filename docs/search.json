I expect everyone to read the papers in advance and come to class with questions on the study’s contribution, empirical techniques, identification strategies, and datasets used. My goal with each paper is to discuss the analysis in detail. As such, the primary reading list is perhaps shorter than a standard PhD course. I’ve provided supplemental reading in each section for those interested in additional readings in a specific area.\nSoftware: For anything data related, I’ll use R, but you are free to use whatever software you’re most comfortable with in your replication. I encourage you to use R, Stata, or Python simply because these are the most common programs used in practice right now. You’ll also need to have a basic working knowledge of Git and GitHub. If you’re new to these tools, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R.\nLogistics: For day-to-day communication, grades, and other private information (such as Zoom meeting links if needed), I’ll use Canvas. I’ll post all other materials to our class website. Please be sure to set up you Canvas alerts so that you receive class announcements in a timely manner.\nSlides and Notes: Any presentations will be made available on our class website prior to any given class."

    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nThere are four main assignments throughout the semester. I describe each assignment below, with more detail provided on our assignments page. Note that I do not expect or want anyone to treat these assignments as entirely separate. By that, I mean you should try to identify datasets from the exercises that you can use in your replication project, and you should try to select papers to present that use those data. At a minimum, you should present the paper that you will be replicating. With a little bit of up-front planning, you can create a lot of overlap across assignments, which will make your life much easier.\n\nResearch Proposals\nYou will submit four research proposals throughout the semester. These are short, 1-2 page documents that outline a research question, the relevant literature, and a proposed empirical strategy. The goal of these proposals is to help you develop your own research ideas and to get feedback from me and your classmates. You will submit one proposal roughly every 3 weeks and present the proposal to the class. After you’ve presented and received feedback on four proposals, you will develop the best of these proposals into a more complete research plan. Details of the research proposal and plans are available on the assignments page of our class website.\n\n\nReplication\nThere is an applied component of this course where we spend some time replicating analyses from selected papers based on real-world data. You will be asked to pick one such paper to more fully replicate. This will require some time to get the data in working order and implement the relevant identification strategy and econometric estimator. Details of the replication are available on the assignments page of our class website.\n\n\nPresentations\nYou will present four papers throughout the course of the semester. Any paper listed as Primary Reading in the class schedule can be selected for presentation. Please inform me of your selected papers no later than Friday, January 26. Please also note your papers and class dates on the Google Sheet here. Details of the expectations for each presentation are available on the assignments page of our class website.\n\n\nImportant Deadlines\nThis section is just to highlight important dates for assignments throughout the semester. Note that late assignments will receive an automatic 5% reduction in the grade for each day the assignment is turned in after the due date.\n\nSelect Papers to Present no later than January 26: Note the papers you plan to present on the Presentations tab of the Google Sheet here. Only one student per paper, so this is first-come first-served. Remember you need to select four papers to present throughout the semester. Please spread these presentations out over the semester.\nSelect Paper to Replicate no later than February 2: Note the paper you plan to replicate on the Replications tab of the Google Sheet here. Only one student per paper, so this is first-come first-served.\nThe first round of Research Proposals and Presentations will be on February 2, 9, and 16\nThe second round of Research Proposals and Presentations will be on February 23, March 1, and March 8\nThe third round of Research Proposals and Presentations will be on March 22, March 29, and April 5\nThe fourth and final round of Research Proposals and Presentations will be on April 12, 19, and 26\nReplications are due on April 26\nFinal Research Plans are due on April 29"

    "text": "Homework\nThe homework assignments are almost entirely empirical, with each assignment focusing on a specific identification strategy, research question, and health-related dataset. I will provide all answers in R; however, you are free to use any software you’d like. Just keep in mind that I will be best able to answer your questions if you also use R. I can also answer most any question if you choose to use Stata. I can point you in the right direction with Python, but I likely can’t provide you with any sample code or specific syntax advice.\nPlease submit all of your homework answers as a PDF via GradeScope (accessed from Canvas). Your PDF must also include a hyperlink to a GitHub repository with all of your code files. If you keep the repository private, please be sure to share the repository with me using my ian.mccarthy@emory.edu email address. I strongly encourage you to use RMarkdown, Quarto, or Jupyter Notebooks, which will help you to easily create PDFs and is much better for writing data-oriented documents. If you are not familiar with these tools, take a look at the following resources:\n\nR Markdown: The Definitive Guide\nUsing R Markdown for Class Reports\nIntroduction to Quarto\nQuarto in R for Data Science\nIntroduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n\nIf you’re new to these tools, then there will be some growing pains. Please be patient with yourself and stick to it. One of the goals of the course is to develop good workflow habits. This means doing work in a way that minimizes mistakes and maximizes reproducibility. These tools exist exactly for these reasons. It allows you to keep your data analysis and the description of that analysis together in a single document or group of documents. It’s really easy to introduce mistakes when copying and pasting empirical results into a text document, and it’s even easier to waste hours (days/weeks?) re-pasting results into your text document and re-writing the results accordingly. Doing everything in R Markdown, Quarto, or Jupyter Notebooks avoids all of these issues. In the long run, it’s much more efficient.\nNote that, for your submission, I do not need to see all of your code. Your PDF should be a finalized, clean, visually engaging summary of your work. The code belongs in the GitHub repository.\nEach homework assignment is worth 30 points toward your final grade (15% each) and consists of 10 individual questions. Each question is worth 3 points, graded as follows:\n\n1 point for an attempted answer as of the initial due date\n1 point for a nearly-correct answer as of the revision date\n1 point for a correct final answer as of the final due date\n\nDue to the staged structure of each assignment, you should submit three PDFs for each assignment, and your repository should similarly be organized with three subfolders for each submission. To make it easy to navigate everyone’s repositories, we need everyone to adopt the same directory structure and naming convention. Please be sure to name your solution documents as follows: lastname-firstinitial-hwk(num)-(submission num). For example, if I’m finalizing the initial submission for homework 1, then the file should be named mccarthy-i-hwk1-1.pdf. A complete directory structure is provided below. Please adopt this structure as it will also help you to keep your analysis and data organized. Finally, please note that you should not include the “data” folder in git or github. The data files are too big and should never be tracked in that way. Instead, please be sure to add the data folder to your gitignore file.\nhomework1\n|   README.md\n|\n|---data (not tracked in git or pushed to github)\n|   |   input (symbolic links)\n|   |   output (analytic data sets)\n|\n|---submission1\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk1-1.pdf\n|\n|---submission2\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk1-2.pdf\n|\n|---submission3\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk1-3.pdf\n|"

There are certainly more than two areas of active research in the study of health insurance, but these are two that I think are particularly important to understand.\n\nHealth Insurance Design and Consumer Behavior: The design of health insurance plans (like copayments, deductibles, and coverage decisions) directly affects consumer choices and healthcare utilization. This area is crucial for policy design, ensuring that insurance structures meet both economic efficiency and equity goals. We’ll discuss Brown and Jeon (n.d.) and Ho and Lee (2020) as an example of this line of current/future research.\nInnovation/Technology Adoption and Health Insurance: In affecting how services are paid for, insurance can also affect the adoption of new technologies and innovations in healthcare. We’ll discuss Agha, Kim, and Li (2022) as an example of this line of work.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAgha, Leila, Soomi Kim, and Danielle Li. 2022. “Insurance Design and Pharmaceutical Innovation.” American Economic Review: Insights 4 (2): 191–208. https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20210063.\n\n\nBrown, Zach Y, and Jihye Jeon. n.d. “Endogenous Information and Simplifying Insurance Choice.”\n\n\nHo, Kate, and Robin S.

The goal in arranging each topic in this way is to focus on a couple of key papers that capture the general state of knowlege in that area and a couple of papers that are pushing the frontier of knowledge in that area. The final part of each topic is a list of questions that I think are important to answer in that area. These questions are meant to be a starting point for your research proposals, and are not meant to be exhaustive.

    "text": "What does health insurance do?\nThe most basic function of health insurance is to protect against the financial risk of health shocks. But health insurance also provides access to health care services, which can improve health outcomes. Health insurance might also encourage overuse by shielding patients from the financial implications of their health and health care decisions (i.e., ex ante and ex post moral hazard). And naturally, the extent to which health insurance succeeds in these areas for a given patient will depend on how well that patient’s needs match the plan (i.e., the choice of their health insurance plan, which is a difficult choice to make). Some of the key papers in this literature are listed below. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a list of papers that I have found useful in my own research. I’ve excluded papers focusing on the long-term effects of health insurance (e.g., on education, future labor market outcomes, or intergenerational health). If you’re intersted in that space, you might start with Miller and Wherry (2018) and East et al. (2023). There’s also a large literature on the effects of health insurance on labor force participation and mobility, which we won’t cover here. For a review of that literature, you might start with Gruber and Madrian (2002).\n\n    List of Key Papers (click to expand)"

    "text": "Health insurance markets\nOne of the key features of health insurance markets is the presence of adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with different health risks have different preferences for health insurance. For example, individuals with high health risks may be more likely to purchase health insurance than individuals with low health risks. This can lead to a market failure in which health insurance is not offered at a price that is affordable to low-risk individuals. The consequences of adverse selection have been known for a very long time - for an initial treatment of this topic, see Ackerloff (1970) and Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976).\n\n    List of Key Papers (click to expand)"

    "text": "The goal for today’s class is to understand the effects of health insurance and the complexity of choosing a health insurance plan. While there is a substantial literature in this area, we’ll focus on the following four papers (or groups of papers) in class. These papers generally address the effects of health insurance on healthcare utilization (including the role of moral hazard), health, and financial strain, and the complexities of health insurance choice. These are areas where the existing literature is relatively robust.\n\nAron-Dine, Einav, and Finkelstein (2013)\nThis paper revisits the findings of the original RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) conducted between 1974 and 1982. The RAND HIE was one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of its time, randomly assigning families to different health insurance plans with varying levels of cost-sharing to assess the impact on healthcare utilization and outcomes. This later analysis, conducted three decades after the original experiment, aims to provide a modern interpretation of the HIE’s findings.\nThe authors find that higher cost-sharing reduces healthcare utilization. This doesn’t have a significant health effect for most patients, but it does for certain vulnerable populations, such as the chronically ill. The paper also provides methodological insights, discussing the strengths and limitations of the original RAND experiment and the implications for current health economics research. Overall, the paper underscores the importance of the RAND HIE’s findings, highlighting how cost-sharing can influence healthcare utilization without broadly affecting health outcomes, and contextualizes these insights in the modern healthcare environment.\n\n\nBaicker et al. (2013) and Finkelstein et al. (2012)\nThe authors exploited a unique opportunity in Oregon, where a limited number of Medicaid slots were allocated through a lottery to low-income adults. This lottery system essentially created a randomized controlled experiment, allowing the researchers to compare outcomes between those who received Medicaid coverage and those who did not. Both studies found that Medicaid coverage resulted in increased healthcare utilization, including more doctor visits, hospital admissions, and prescription medications. Medicaid coverage also led to a significant reduction in financial strain for recipients, such as lowering the incidence of catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures and reducing the likelihood of unpaid medical bills. While Baicker et al. (2013) finds no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes (like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control), Finkelstein et al. (2012) finds that Medicaid coverage led to a significant reduction in the incidence of depression and improved self-reported health.\n\n\nEinav, Finkelstein, and Mahoney (2018)\nThis paper is a review and analysis of the concept of moral hazard in health insurance. The authors explain moral hazard as the phenomenon where insurance coverage changes the insured individual’s behavior, leading to increased utilization of healthcare services. This concept is central in the design and evaluation of health insurance policies. The paper surveys empirical evidence of moral hazrd from various studies, including randomized experiments like the RAND Health Insurance Experiment. The authors also discuss the challenge of quantifying the extent of moral hazard and the importance of designing policies that balance the need to provide financial protection (insurance) while minimizing inefficient overuse of healthcare resources.\n\n\nAbaluck and Gruber (2011), Jonathan D. Ketcham et al. (2012), Jonathan D. Ketcham, Kuminoff, and Powers (2016) and Abaluck and Gruber (2016)\nThese papers all deal with the idea of poor decision making in health insurance choice. The authors show that many people make suboptimal choices when selecting health insurance plans, and the papers essentially debate the source of this “poor” decision making and the scope of improvment from government intervention. These papers collectively speak to the importance of understanding how people make decisions in health insurance markets, and the implications for designing policies that can improve outcomes and best match people to health insurance plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAbaluck, Jason, and Jonathan Gruber. 2011. “Choice Inconsistencies Among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part D Program.” American Economic Review 101 (4): 1180–210. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.4.1180.\n\n\n———. 2016. “Choice Inconsistencies Among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part D Program: Reply.” American Economic Review 106 (12): 3962–87. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20151318.\n\n\nAron-Dine, Aviva, Liran Einav, and Amy Finkelstein. 2013. “The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, Three Decades Later.” Journal of Economic Perspectives 27 (1): 197–222.\n\n\nBaicker, Katherine, Sarah L.

    "text": "The more recent literature in health insurance tends to consider more indirect effects of health insurance, such as reductions in payment delinquency in other areas (non-healthcare spending) or effects of health insurance on provider behaviors. There is also a recent literature concerned with how to improve the quality of an enrollee’s health insurance plan, which draws heavily on earlier studies of health insurance demand but focuses on more current policy issues such as administrative barriers, default plan selections, etc. For this class, we’ll focus on the following papers:\n\nHu et al. (2018)\nThis paper examines the financial impacts of the Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The authors use credit report data and a difference-in-differences strategy to analyze the financial outcomes for individuals in states that expanded Medicaid compared to those in states that did not. They find that ACA Medicaid expansions led to significant reductions in the amount of unpaid bills, the amount of debt in collections, and the credit scores of individuals who gained Medicaid coverage. The reductions in unpaid bills and debts were primarily driven by decreases in medical debts, but not exclusively.\n\n\nFinkelstein (2007) and Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2019)\nI lump these papers together because they both speak to effects of health insurance beyond an individual patient or enrollee. Finkelstein (2007) examines the broader economic impacts of the introduction of Medicare in the U.S. She finds that the introduction of Medicare led to a significant increase in hospital spending, responsible for a substantial portion of the 37 percent increase in hospital spending between 1965 and 1970. They also discuss how the increased spending due to Medicare led to rapid growth in the healthcare sector, influencing not only healthcare delivery but also labor markets and infrastructure within the sector. The paper underscores the need to consider both direct and indirect effects of large scale policies such as Medicare.\nFinkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2019) considers the value of Medicaid coverage using the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. The study estimates that low-income uninsured adults’ willingness to pay for Medicaid ranges from $0.5 to $1.2 per dollar of the resource cost of providing Medicaid. The authors show that 60% of Medicaid’s gross expenditures, or $3600 per recipient, are essentially transfers to parties who would otherwise subsidize medical care for the low-income uninsured, leaving the net cost of Medicaid at about $1450 per recipient. The paper concludes that Medicaid serves dual roles: as a monetary transfer to external parties and as a subsidized insurance product for recipients, with recipient willingness to pay for Medicaid significantly below its gross cost​.\n\n\nBrot-Goldberg et al. (2023)\nThis paper leverages two natural experiments to study the impact of default options in public drug insurance for low-income elderly in the U.S. The study finds that default plan selections significantly influence plan enrollment and drug utilization, with 96% of beneficiaries following an exogenously changed default. The paper proposes a general framework for choice under costly cognition, suggesting that both paternalistic defaults (steering consumers to suitable plans) and ‘shocking’ defaults (triggering active choices) could be optimal, depending on a key parameter: the elasticity of active choice propensity relative to the default value. However, they find this elasticity to be close to zero, indicating minimal active choice difference between beneficiaries assigned to well-matched vs. poorly-matched defaults. The study also shows that poorly-matched defaults lead to significant declines in drug consumption, suggesting that the welfare losses from following these defaults likely outweigh any potential gains from induced active choices. A third natural experiment reveals that the limited active choice observed seems largely random, driven by transient attentional shifts within beneficiaries. The results highlight the importance of paternalistic defaults in insurance market design, likely benefiting beneficiaries more than harming them.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrot-Goldberg, Zarek, Timothy Layton, Boris Vabson, and Adelina Yanyue Wang. 2023. “The Behavioral Foundations of Default Effects: Theory and Evidence from Medicare Part D.” American Economic Review 113 (10): 2718–58. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20210013.\n\n\nFinkelstein, Amy. 2007. “The Aggregate Effects of Health Insurance: Evidence from the Introduction of Medicare.” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 122 (1): 1–37. https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.122.1.1.\n\n\nFinkelstein, Amy, Nathaniel Hendren, and Erzo F.
