I expect everyone to read the papers in advance and come to class with questions on the study’s contribution, empirical techniques, identification strategies, and datasets used. My goal with each paper is to discuss the analysis in detail. As such, the primary reading list is perhaps shorter than a standard PhD course. I’ve provided a more comprehensive reading list in each module for those interested in additional readings in a specific area.\nSoftware: For anything data related, I’ll use R, but you are free to use whatever software you’re most comfortable with in your empirical work. I encourage you to use R, Stata, or Python simply because these are the most common programs used in practice right now. You’ll also need to have a basic working knowledge of Git and GitHub. If you’re new to these tools, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R.\nLogistics: For day-to-day communication, grades, and other private information (such as Zoom meeting links if needed), I’ll use Canvas. I’ll post all other materials to our class website. Please be sure to set up you Canvas alerts so that you receive class announcements in a timely manner.\nSlides and Notes: Any presentations will be made available on our class website prior to any given class."

    "section": "Assignments and Grading",
    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nThere are four main assignments throughout the semester. I describe each assignment below, with more detail provided on our assignments page.\n\nResearch Proposals\nYou will submit four research proposals throughout the semester. These are short, 1-2 page documents that outline a problem/motivation, a related research question, potential data to help answer this question, and a proposed empirical strategy. The goal of these proposals is to help you develop your own research ideas and to get feedback from me and your classmates. You will submit one proposal roughly every 3 weeks and present the proposal to the class. After you’ve presented and received feedback on four proposals, you will develop the best of these proposals into a more complete research plan. Details of the research proposal and plans are available on the assignments page of our class website.\nPlease select a date to present your research proposals on the Proposals tab of the Google Sheet here no later than Friday, January 26. Note that even though the presentations are spread out over three weeks for each proposal, everyone has the same due date.\n\n\nPresentations\nYou will present four papers throughout the course of the semester. Please note your selected papers and class dates on the Presentations tab of the Google Sheet here no later than Friday, January 26. If you do not select papers by then, I will assign you papers randomly. The list of potential papers to present and details of the expectations for each presentation are available on the assignments page of our class website.\n\n\nEmpirical Exercises\nThere is an applied component of this course where we spend some time with a real-life causal inference question. These will require some of your time outside of class to get the data in working order and implement the relevant identification strategy and econometric estimator. Raw data for each exercise will be provided on our class OneDrive notebook, the link to which is on Canvas. There are four possible empirical exercises, from which you must choose one. Please note your selection paper on the Exercises tab of the Google Sheet here no later than February 2.\n\n\nImportant Deadlines\nThis section is just to highlight important dates for assignments throughout the semester. Note that late assignments will receive an automatic 5% reduction in the grade for each day the assignment is turned in after the due date.\n\nSelect Papers to Present no later than January 26: Note the papers you plan to present on the Presentations tab of the Google Sheet here. Only one student per paper, so this is first-come first-served. Remember you need to select four papers to present throughout the semester. Please spread these presentations out over the semester.\nSelect Research Proposal Presentation Dates no later than January 26: Note the dates you plan to present your proposals on the Proposals tab of the Google Sheet here. Only two students can present on any given Friday.\nSelect Empirical Exercise no later than February 2: Note your selection on the Exercises tab of the Google Sheet here. No more than two students per exercise.\nThe first round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on February 2\nThe second round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on February 23\nThe third round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on March 22\nThe fourth and final round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on April 12\nEmpirical Exercises are due on April 26\nFinal Research Plans are due on April 29"

    "text": "What does health insurance do?\nThe most basic function of health insurance is to protect against the financial risk of health shocks. But health insurance also provides access to health care services, which can improve health outcomes. Health insurance might also encourage overuse by shielding patients from the financial implications of their health and health care decisions (i.e., ex ante and ex post moral hazard). And naturally, the extent to which health insurance succeeds in these areas for a given patient will depend on how well that patient’s needs match the plan (i.e., the choice of their health insurance plan, which is a difficult choice to make). Some of the key papers in this literature are listed below. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a list of papers that I have found useful in my own research. I’ve excluded papers focusing on the long-term effects of health insurance (e.g., on education, future labor market outcomes, or intergenerational health). If you’re intersted in that space, you might start with Miller and Wherry (2018) and East et al. (2023). There’s also a large literature on the effects of health insurance on labor force participation and mobility, which we won’t cover here. For a review of that literature, you might start with Gruber and Madrian (2002).\n\n    List of Key Papers (click to expand)"

    "text": "Health insurance markets\nOne of the key features of health insurance markets is the presence of adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with different health risks have different preferences for health insurance. For example, individuals with high health risks may be more likely to purchase health insurance than individuals with low health risks. This can lead to a market failure in which health insurance is not offered at a price that is affordable to low-risk individuals. The consequences of adverse selection have been known for a very long time - for an initial treatment of this topic, see Ackerloff (1970) and Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976).\n\n    List of Key Papers (click to expand)"

While there is a substantial literature in this area, we’ll focus on the following papers (or groups of papers) in class. These papers generally address how to model competition in health insurance, the effects of competitiveness on health insurance premiums, and the effects of adverse selection on health insurance market equilibrium. These are areas where the existing literature is relatively robust.\n\nBundorf, Levin, and Mahoney (2012) and Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2010)\nThese papers provide some of the standard tools and current results in the study of health insurance competition. They analyze how consumers respond to prices when selecting health plans, focusing on the implications for consumer welfare and market efficiency. This research contributes to understanding consumer behavior in health insurance markets and the role of pricing in health plan choice.\n\n\nDafny, Duggan, and Ramanarayanan (2012)\nThis paper examines competition in health insurance markets and quantifies the effect of insurer market power on premiums. Dafny, Duggan, and Ramanarayanan (2012) is particularly relevant in the context of policy debates regarding the regulation of insurance markets and the potential benefits of increasing competition to control healthcare costs.\n\n\nB. R. Handel (2013), B. Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2015), and B. R. Handel, Kolstad, and Spinnewijn (2019)\nThese papers collectively provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges posed by adverse selection and information asymmetries in health insurance markets, and the potential unintended consequences of policy interventions.

The goal in arranging each topic in this way is to focus on a couple of key papers that capture the general state of knowlege in that area and a couple of papers that are pushing the frontier of knowledge in that area. The final part of each topic is a list of questions that I think are important to answer in that area. These questions are meant to be a starting point for your research proposals, and are not meant to be exhaustive.

    "text": "The goal for today’s class is to understand the effects of health insurance and the complexity of choosing a health insurance plan. While there is a substantial literature in this area, we’ll focus on the following four papers (or groups of papers) in class. These papers generally address the effects of health insurance on healthcare utilization (including the role of moral hazard), health, and financial strain, and the complexities of health insurance choice. These are areas where the existing literature is relatively robust.\n\nAron-Dine, Einav, and Finkelstein (2013)\nThis paper revisits the findings of the original RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) conducted between 1974 and 1982. The RAND HIE was one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of its time, randomly assigning families to different health insurance plans with varying levels of cost-sharing to assess the impact on healthcare utilization and outcomes. This later analysis, conducted three decades after the original experiment, aims to provide a modern interpretation of the HIE’s findings.\nThe authors find that higher cost-sharing reduces healthcare utilization. This doesn’t have a significant health effect for most patients, but it does for certain vulnerable populations, such as the chronically ill. The paper also provides methodological insights, discussing the strengths and limitations of the original RAND experiment and the implications for current health economics research. Overall, the paper underscores the importance of the RAND HIE’s findings, highlighting how cost-sharing can influence healthcare utilization without broadly affecting health outcomes, and contextualizes these insights in the modern healthcare environment.\n\n\nBaicker et al. (2013) and Finkelstein et al. (2012)\nThe authors exploited a unique opportunity in Oregon, where a limited number of Medicaid slots were allocated through a lottery to low-income adults. This lottery system essentially created a randomized controlled experiment, allowing the researchers to compare outcomes between those who received Medicaid coverage and those who did not. Both studies found that Medicaid coverage resulted in increased healthcare utilization, including more doctor visits, hospital admissions, and prescription medications. Medicaid coverage also led to a significant reduction in financial strain for recipients, such as lowering the incidence of catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures and reducing the likelihood of unpaid medical bills. While Baicker et al. (2013) finds no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes (like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control), Finkelstein et al. (2012) finds that Medicaid coverage led to a significant reduction in the incidence of depression and improved self-reported health.\n\n\nEinav, Finkelstein, and Mahoney (2018)\nThis paper is a review and analysis of the concept of moral hazard in health insurance. The authors explain moral hazard as the phenomenon where insurance coverage changes the insured individual’s behavior, leading to increased utilization of healthcare services. This concept is central in the design and evaluation of health insurance policies. The paper surveys empirical evidence of moral hazrd from various studies, including randomized experiments like the RAND Health Insurance Experiment. The authors also discuss the challenge of quantifying the extent of moral hazard and the importance of designing policies that balance the need to provide financial protection (insurance) while minimizing inefficient overuse of healthcare resources.\n\n\nAbaluck and Gruber (2011), Jonathan D. Ketcham et al. (2012), Jonathan D. Ketcham, Kuminoff, and Powers (2016) and Abaluck and Gruber (2016)\nThese papers all deal with the idea of poor decision making in health insurance choice. The authors show that many people make suboptimal choices when selecting health insurance plans, and the papers essentially debate the source of this “poor” decision making and the scope of improvment from government intervention. These papers collectively speak to the importance of understanding how people make decisions in health insurance markets, and the implications for designing policies that can improve outcomes and best match people to health insurance plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAbaluck, Jason, and Jonathan Gruber. 2011. “Choice Inconsistencies Among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part D Program.” American Economic Review 101 (4): 1180–210. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.4.1180.\n\n\n———. 2016. “Choice Inconsistencies Among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part D Program: Reply.” American Economic Review 106 (12): 3962–87. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20151318.\n\n\nAron-Dine, Aviva, Liran Einav, and Amy Finkelstein. 2013. “The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, Three Decades Later.” Journal of Economic Perspectives 27 (1): 197–222.\n\n\nBaicker, Katherine, Sarah L.

I like to motivate the study of physician agency with a discussion of healthcare variation, which is the basic empirical fact that healthcare utilization varies substantially across and even within geographic areas.

As such, we’ll first introduce the evidence on variation in healthcare and then turn to some background on physician agency."

Each proposal is worth 10 points toward your final grade, 8 points for the written proposal and 2 points for the presentation. The written proposal should be 2 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins, and the presentation should be 10-15 minutes and no more than 5 slides.\nYou’ll present four proposals thoughout the semester. Please pick dates for each proposal and sign up on the Proposals tab of the Google Sheet here by January 26. Note that you have to pick one date for each proposal, so you can really only choose between three days for each proposal. All written proposals and presentations are due via Canvas by the first due date in each block (2/2, 2/23, 3/22, and 4/12). So if you select 2/9 as your presentation date for the first proposal, you still have to submit your written proposal and presentation slides by 2/2. This is just to ensure a common due date for everyone.\nThink of the research proposal as a more informed version of brainstorming. This should be something for which you’ve given some serious thought but where you haven’t yet started any analysis. You at least have some idea of the data you’d like to use, where to find it, and how to use it (i.e., you have some identification strategy and estimation method in mind). The purpose of the proposal is to get feedback from me and your peers on your research idea.\nThere will be a lot of constructive criticism in these proposals and presentations. This is a good thing! It’s how we learn. But it can be a bit uncomfortable at first. The key is to disassociate yourself from your research. It’s not personal. It’s just research. And it’s not even research yet. It’s just an idea. So don’t take it personally. And don’t be afraid to give constructive criticism to others, provided it’s delivered in a respectful manner. The more we can create a constructive, supportive, and participative environment, the easier and more productive these propposals will be for everyone."

We’ll cover the basics of strict and fuzzy RD, and we’ll work through standard specification tests. We’ll also introduce some more technical aspects of bin and bandwidth selection.\n\n\nResources and data\nThe data for this assignment comes from the AEJ: Policy website, where Keith Ericson’s complete dataset is available. The data are available here. I’ve also uploaded the data to our class OneDrive folder under the directory “Ericson 2014.”\n\n\nQuestions\nIn your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions.\n\nRecreate the table of descriptive statistics (Table 1) from Ericson (2014).\nRecreate Figure 3 from Ericson (2014).\nCalonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) discuss the appropriate partition size for binned scatterplots such as that in Figure 3 of Ericson (2014). More formally, denote by \\(\\mathcal{P}_{-,n} = \\{ P_{-,j} : j=1, 2, ... J_{-, n} \\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}_{+,n} = \\{ P_{+,j} : j=1, 2, ... J_{+, n} \\}\\) the partitions of the support of the running variable \\(x_{i}\\) on the left and right (respectively) of the cutoff, \\(\\bar{x}\\). \\(P_{-, j}\\) and \\(P_{+, n}\\) denote the actual supports for each \\(j\\) partition of size \\(J_{-,n}\\) and \\(J_{+,n}\\), such that \\([x_{l}, \\bar{x}) = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{J_{-,n}} P_{-, j}\\) and \\((\\bar{x}, x_{u}] = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{J_{+,n}} P_{+, j}\\). Individual bins are denoted by \\(p_{-,j}\\) and \\(p_{+,j}\\). With this notation in hand, we can write the partitions \\(J_{-,n}\\) and \\(J_{+,n}\\) with equally-spaced bins as \\[p_{-,j}=x_{l} + j \\times \\frac{\\bar{x} - x_{l}}{J_{-,n}},\\] and \\[p_{+,j} = \\bar{x} + j \\times \\frac{x_{u} - \\bar{x}}{J_{+,n}}.\\] Recreate Figure 3 from Ericson (2014) using \\(J_{-,n}=J_{+,n}=10\\) and \\(J_{-,n}=J_{+,n}=30\\). Discuss your results and compare them to your figure in Part 2.\nWith the notation above, Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) derive the optimal number of partitions for an evenly-spaced (ES) RD plot. They show that \\[J_{ES,-,n} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{V_{-}}{\\mathcal{V}_{ES,-}} \\frac{n}{\\text{log}(n)^{2}} \\right\\rceil\\] and \\[J_{ES,+,n} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{V_{+}}{\\mathcal{V}_{ES,+}} \\frac{n}{\\text{log}(n)^{2}} \\right\\rceil,\\] where \\(V_{-}\\) and \\(V_{+}\\) denote the sample variance of the subsamples to the left and right of the cutoff and \\(\\mathcal{V}_{ES,.}\\) is an integrated variance term derived in the paper. Use the rdrobust package in R (or Stata or Python) to find the optimal number of bins with an evenly-spaced binning strategy. Report this bin count and recreate your binned scatterplots from parts 2 and 3 based on the optimal bin number.\nOne key underlying assumption for RD design is that agents cannot precisely manipulate the running variable. While “precisely” is not very scientific, we can at least test for whether there appears to be a discrete jump in the running variable around the threshold. Evidence of such a jump may suggest that manipulation is present. Provide the results from the manipulation tests described in Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma (2018). This test can be implemented with the rddensity package in R, Stata, or Python.\nRecreate Panels A and B of Table 3 in Ericson (2014) using the same bandwidth of $4.00 but without any covariates.\nCalonico, Cattaneo, and Farrell (2020) show that pre-existing optimal bandwidth calculations (such as those used in Ericson (2014)) are invalid for appropriate inference. They propose an alternative method to derive minimal coverage error (CE)-optimal bandwidths. Re-estimate your RD results using the CE-optimal bandwidth (rdrobust will do this for you) and compare the bandwidth and RD estimates to that in Table 3 of Ericson (2014).\nNow let’s extend the analysis in Section V of Ericson (2014) using IV. Use the presence of Part D low-income subsidy as an IV for market share to examine the effect of market share in 2006 on future premium changes.\nDiscuss your findings and compare results from different binwidths and bandwidths. Compare your results in part 8 to the invest-then-harvest estimates from Table 4 in Ericson (2014).\nReflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging? What did you find most surprising?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCalonico, Sebastian, Matias D Cattaneo, and Max H Farrell. 2020. “Optimal Bandwidth Choice for Robust Bias-Corrected Inference in Regression Discontinuity Designs.” The Econometrics Journal 23 (2): 192–210. https://doi.org/10.1093/ectj/utz022.\n\n\nCalonico, Sebastian, Matias D.

    "title": "Exercise 1: Difference-in-Differences",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn this exercise, we’re going to focus on causal inference in panel data, specifically on difference-in-differences and event studies. These are the workhorses of modern applied empirical microeconomics (although not as much of a panacea as once perceived). We’ll employ these research designs in the context of hospital “uncompensated care.” The simple question we want to consider is, “Does insurance expansion reduce hospital uncompensated care?”\n\n\nResources and data\nThe data for this assignment comes from three sources. These data will be made available on our class OneDrive folder. Note that you may want to use (or create) a crosswalk file between state names and abbreviations, as different datasets often have different ways to capture “state”. Stata has a user-written program, statastates, that should do what you need. R has a similar object, stcrosswalk, as part of the crosswalkr package.\n\nHospital Cost Report Information System: Hospitals submit cost reports to CMS with a wealth of (very messy) data on the hospital, including information on the extent of uncompensated care provided by the hospital in that fiscal year. You can get started with these data using my GitHub repository, HCRIS.\nProvider of Services files: These raw data (through 2019) are available from NBER POS. Data for more recent years is available directly from the CMS POS Data. The data provide information on characteristics of healthcare providers, including information on hospital ownership type. We’ll use these files to collect some basic hospital-level covariates. You can access my GitHub repository for these data here, as well as a similar repo using Stata from Adam Sacarny, available here.\nMedicaid Expansion: Data on which states expanded Medicaid under the ACA, and when they expanded, is available from the Kaiser Family Foundation website. For more info, see my GitHub repository, Insurance Access. The relevant dataset is also available on our class OneDrive folder, “KFF_medicaid_expansion_2019.txt”.\n\n\n\nQuestions\nFocus on the years from 2003 through 2019, which are years for which data on uncompensated care are available. In your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions.\n\nProvide and discuss a table of simple summary statistics showing the mean, standard deviation, min, and max of hospital total revenues and uncompensated care over time.\nCreate a figure showing the mean hospital uncompensated care from 2003 to 2019. Show this trend separately by hospital ownership type (private not for profit and private for profit).\nUsing a simple DD identification strategy, estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on hospital uncompensated care using a traditional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimation: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\delta D_{it} + \\varepsilon_{it},\n(\\#eq:dd)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(D_{it}=1(E_{i}\\leq t)\\) in Equation @ref(eq:dd) is an indicator set to 1 when a hospital is in a state that expanded as of year \\(t\\) or earlier, \\(\\gamma_{t}\\) denotes time fixed effects, \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) denotes hospital fixed effects, and \\(y_{it}\\) denotes the hospital’s amount of uncompensated care in year \\(t\\). Present four estimates from this estimation in a table: one based on the full sample (regardless of treatment timing); one when limiting to the 2014 treatment group (with never treated as the control group); one when limiting to the 2015 treatment group (with never treated as the control group); and one when limiting to the 2016 treatment group (with never treated as the control group). Briefly explain any differences.\nEstimate an “event study” version of the specification in part 3: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} +\\sum_{\\tau &lt; -1} D_{it}^{\\tau} \\delta_{\\tau} + \\sum_{\\tau&gt;=0} D_{it}^{\\tau} \\delta_{\\tau} + \\varepsilon_{it},\n(\\#eq:event)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(D_{it}^{\\tau} = 1(t-E_{i}=\\tau)\\) in Equation @ref(eq:event) is essentially an interaction between the treatment dummy and a relative time dummy. In this notation and context, \\(\\tau\\) denotes years relative to Medicaid expansion, so that \\(\\tau=-1\\) denotes the year before a state expanded Medicaid, \\(\\tau=0\\) denotes the year of expansion, etc. Estimate with two different samples: one based on the full sample and one based only on those that expanded in 2014 (with never treated as the control group).\nSun and Abraham (SA) show that the \\(\\delta_{\\tau}\\) coefficients in Equation @ref(eq:event) can be written as a non-convex average of all other group-time specific average treatment effects. They propose an interaction weighted specification: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} +\\sum_{e} \\sum_{\\tau \\neq -1} \\left(D_{it}^{\\tau} \\times 1(E_{i}=e)\\right) \\delta_{e, \\tau} + \\varepsilon_{it}.\n(\\#eq:iwevent)\n\\end{equation}\\] Re-estimate your event study using the SA specification in Equation @ref(eq:iwevent). Show your results for \\(\\hat{\\delta}_{e, \\tau}\\) in a Table, focusing on states with \\(E_{i}=2014\\), \\(E_{i}=2015\\), and \\(E_{i}=2016\\).\nPresent an event study graph based on the results in part 5. Hint: you can do this automatically in R with the fixest package (using the sunab syntax for interactions), or with eventstudyinteract in Stata. These packages help to avoid mistakes compared to doing the tables/figures manually and also help to get the standard errors correct.\nCallaway and Sant’Anna (CS) offer a non-parametric solution that effectively calculates a set of group-time specific differences, \\(ATT(g,t)= E[y_{it}(g) - y_{it}(\\infty) | G_{i}=g]\\), where \\(g\\) reflects treatment timing and \\(t\\) denotes time. They show that under the standard DD assumptions of parallel trends and no anticipation, \\(ATT(g,t) = E[y_{it} - y_{i, g-1} | G_{i}=g] - E[y_{it} - y_{i,g-1} | G_{i} = \\infty]\\), so that \\(\\hat{ATT}(g,t)\\) is directly estimable from sample analogs. CS also propose aggregations of \\(\\hat{ATT}(g,t)\\) to form an overall ATT or a time-specific ATT (e.g., ATTs for \\(\\tau\\) periods before/after treatment). With this framework in mind, provide an alternative event study using the CS estimator. Hint: check out the did package in R or the csdid package in Stata.\nRambachan and Roth (RR) show that traditional tests of parallel pre-trends may be underpowered, and they provide an alternative estimator that essentially bounds the treatment effects by the size of an assumed violation in parallel trends. One such bound RR propose is to limit the post-treatment violation of parallel trends to be no worse than some multiple of the pre-treatment violation of parallel trends. Assuming linear trends, such a relative violation is reflected by \\[\\Delta(\\bar{M}) = \\left\\{ \\delta : \\forall t \\geq 0, \\lvert (\\delta_{t+1} - \\delta_{t}) - (\\delta_{t} - \\delta_{t-1}) \\rvert \\leq \\bar{M} \\times \\max_{s&lt;0} \\lvert (\\delta_{s+1} - \\delta_{s}) - (\\delta_{s} - \\delta_{s-1}) \\rvert \\right\\}.\\] The authors also propose a similar approach with what they call “smoothness restrictions,” in which violations in trends changes no more than \\(M\\) between periods. The only difference is that one restriction is imposed relative to observed trends, and one restriction is imposed using specific values. Using the HonestDiD package in R or Stata, present a sensitivity plot of your CS ATT estimates using smoothness restrictions, with assumed violations of size \\(M \\in \\left\\{ 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 \\right\\}\\). Check out the GitHub repo here for some help in combining the HonestDiD package with CS estimates. Note that you’ll need to edit the function in that repo in order to use pre-specified smoothness restrictions. You can do that by simply adding Mvec=Mvec in the createSensitivityResults function for type=smoothness.\nDiscuss your findings and compare estimates from different estimators (e.g., are your results sensitive to different specifications or estimators? Are your results sensitive to violation of parallel trends assumptions?).\nReflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging? What did you find most surprising?"

The exercises are listed and described in more detail below:\n\nExercise 1: Difference-in-differences\nExercise 2: Instrumental variables\nExercise 3: Regression Discontinuity\nExercise 4: Hospital markets + demand estimation\n\nPlease submit your answers as a GitHub Repository link on Canvas no later than 11:59pm on April 26. In your repoository, please include a final document with your main answers and analyses in a PDF. Be sure to also include in your repository all of your supporting documentation, including your code files (Stata, R, Python, SAS, etc.), all figures/tables, and some instructions (e.g., as part of your ReadMe file) that introduce the reader to your data and the sequence in which your code should be run. Practice writing good code and showing me only what I would need to recreate your results.\nThe exercise is worth 30 points toward your final grade, with 20 points allocated to the accuracy of your work (2 points for each of 10 questions) and 10 points allocated to the replicability of your work (i.e., can I easily recreate your answers from your repository?)\nIn your project, please be sure to organize your folders in a useful way. The way I organize things (though certainly not the only way to do it) is to keep a folder for each new project and named accordingly. I typically have the following subfolders:\n\nData: This is where I keep the raw data files and any additional data files I create as part of my analysis. I also keep a “Research Data” folder on my computer that has raw data that I access regularly, in which case the “Data” folder in any given project includes symbolic links to the original raw data. I usually split this folder into two: “input” for raw data; and “output” for final or intermediate datasets.\nData Code: This is where I keep the code for data management (merging, clean-up, wrangling, etc.). Final analytic datasets created by this code go to the “Data/output” subdirectory.\nAnalysis: This is where I keep my analysis code files and log files (if relevant).\nResults: Output from the analysis code files. I tend to separate this into two subfolders - one for tables and one for figures.\nPapers: If I’m writing the paper in R Markdown or Quarto, this is where I keep all of the markdown files. With most co-authored work, though, we write in Overleaf. In that case, I’ll still download different versions of the paper into this folder when necessary (e.g., for different journal submissions)\nPresentation: This is where I keep my slides and underlying code files.\n\nIt’s good to start developing some organization practices that work best for you. It’s extremely easy to forget what you were doing on a project once you have several things going at once, especially when you wait for 6-8 months after submitting a paper for publication. The last thing you want is to not be able to replicate your own work!"

    "title": "Exercise 2: Instrumental Variables",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn this assignment, we’re going to work through some applied issues related to instrumental variables. For a long time, IV (or 2SLS) was a very common identification strategy for applied empirical micro, but it fell out of favor as people became more aware of the assumptions underlying the estimator and better understood what IV actually estimates (not the ATE in most cases). People also started to find other strategies that were more compelling in some applications (and of course with some other assumptions). In this assignment, we’re going to study the effects of a physician’s affiliation with a hospital on physician practice patterns, and we’ll instrument for physician affiliation using some specific Medicare payment shocks.\n\n\nResources and data\nThe data for this assignment comes from three sources:\n\nMD-PPAS; The Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty includes data on physician specialties, practice IDs, demographics, and place of service. Be sure to follow the link and read the data documentation. We’ll use these data to construct a measure of physician integration.\nMedicare Utilization and Payment Data: These files provide data on the quantities and Medicare spending of each physician and service. We’ll use these data to capture total physician-level billing activity, and we’ll use the service-level data to measure the revenue effects from our plausibly exogenous policy shock. These data are only available beginning in 2012. These files are large but otherwise relatively clean and easy to use, so there’s no separate repo for these data. Note that we will only work with data for MDs, so you can drop a lot of observations with that restriction.\nPhysician Fee Schedule 2010 Update: Our instrument mainly consists of a shock to physician payments introduced in 2010. The shock further increased payments for services in an outpatient facility compared to services billed in a physician’s office. The GitHub repo (linked above) provides code to recreate a dataset with service-specific price shocks introduced by the 2010 fee schedule update. To save us some time, I’ve posed the final dataset from that repo into our class data folder.\n\n\n\nQuestions\nIn your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions. Note that our utilization and payment data only start in 2012 (just a limitation of using publicly available data), while the price shock first takes place in 2010. Thankfully, the price shock was introduced gradually from 2010 through 2013, so our instrument (see question 4 below) still has some variation over our time period. For all of this analysis, please focus only on the years from 2012 through 2017 and focus only on MDs (based on the “NPPES Credentials” field in the PUF data). Please use the raw values for your summary statistics, but you might consider using logs in the rest of the analysis due to the heavily skewed nature of the data.\n\nProvide and discuss a table of simple summary statistics showing the mean, standard deviation, min, and max of total physician-level Medicare spending, claims, and patients. Use the Medicare utilization and payment data to calculate total spending, claims, and patients at the physician level. You can do this using the average Medicare allowed amt * bene_day_srvc_cnt (or Medicare allowed amt * line_srvc_cnt) for spending, bene_day_srvc_cnt or the line_srvc_cnt for claims, and bene_unique_cnt for patients. The patient counts will include some overlap since the data are by service, but that’s OK for our purposes.\nForm a proxy for integration using the ratio: \\[\\begin{equation}\nINT_{it} = \\mathbf{1} \\left(\\frac{HOPD_{it}}{HOPD_{it} + OFFICE_{it} + ASC_{it}} \\geq 0.75\\right),\n(\\#eq:int)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(HOPD_{it}\\) reflects the total number of claims in which physician \\(i\\) bills in a hospital outpatient setting, \\(OFFICE_{it}\\) is the total number of claims billed to an office setting, and \\(ASC_{it}\\) is the total number of claims billed to an ambulatory surgery center. As reflected in Equation @ref(eq:int), you can assume that any physician with at least 75% of claims billed in an outpatient setting is integrated with a hospital. Using this 75% threshold, plot the mean of total physician-level claims for integrated versus non-integrated physicians over time.\nEstimate the relationship between integration on (log) total physician claims using OLS, with the following specification: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\delta INT_{it} + \\beta x_{it} + \\gamma_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\varepsilon_{it},\n(\\#eq:ols)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(INT_{it}\\) is defined in Equation @ref(eq:int), \\(x_{it}\\) captures time-varying physician characteristics, and \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{t}\\) denote physician and time fixed effects. Please focus on physician’s that weren’t yet integrated as of 2012, that way we have some pre-integration data for everyone. Impose this restriction for the remaining questions. Feel free to experiment with different covariates in \\(x_{it}\\) or simply omit that term and only include the fixed effects.\nHow much should we be “worried” about endogeneity here? Extending the work of Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005), Oster (2019) derives the expression \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\delta^{*} \\approx \\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}} - \\rho \\times \\left[\\hat{\\delta}_{D} - \\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}}\\right] \\times \\frac{R_{max}^{2} - R_{D,x_{1}}^{2}}{R_{D,x_{1}}^{2} - R_{D}^{2}} \\xrightarrow{p} \\delta,\n(\\#eq:oster)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(x_{1}\\) captures our observable covariates (or fixed effects in our case); \\(\\delta\\) denotes the treatment effect of interest; \\(\\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}}\\) denotes the coefficient on \\(D\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(D\\) and \\(x_{1}\\); \\(R_{D,x_{1}}^{2}\\) denotes the \\(R^{2}\\) from that regression; \\(\\hat{\\delta}_{D}\\) denotes the coefficient on \\(D\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(D\\) only; \\(R_{D}^{2}\\) reflects the \\(R^{2}\\) from that regression; \\(R_{max}^{2}\\) denotes an unobserved “maximum” \\(R^{2}\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(D\\), observed covariates \\(x_{1}\\), and some unobserved covariates \\(x_{2}\\); and \\(\\rho\\) denotes the degree of selection on observed variables relative to unobserved variables. One approach that Oster suggests is to consider a range of \\(R^{2}_{max}\\) and \\(\\rho\\) to bound the estimated treatment effect, where the bounds are given by \\(\\left[ \\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}}, \\delta^{*}(R^{2}_{max}, \\rho) \\right]\\). Construct these bounds based on all combinations of \\(\\rho \\in (0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2)\\) and \\(R_{max}^{2} \\in (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1)\\) and present your results in a table. What do your results say about the extent to which selection on observables could be problematic here? Hint: you can also look into psacalc in Stata or robomit in R for implementation of Oster (2019) in Stata or R, respectively.\nConstruct the change in Medicare payments achievable for an integrated versus non-integrated physician practice due to the 2010 update to the physician fee schedule, \\(\\Delta P_{it}\\). Use this as an instrument for \\(INT_{it}\\) in a 2SLS estimator following the same specification as in Equation @ref(eq:ols). Present your results along with those of your “first stage” and “reduced form”.\n\nHere is a little code snippet to help you work with the fee schedule update and the utilization and payment data in constructing the instrument. In this code chunk, the medicare.puf object is the provider and utilization data for a specific year, the pfs.yearly object is the physician fee schedule update data for the same year (except for years after 2013, in which case pfs.yearly should just be the 2013 data because the price shock is fully implemented as of 2013), and the taxid.base object is the MD-PPAS data from 2009 limited to just the NPI and the group1 variable (the group1 and group2 variables are encrypted versions of the physician’s tax ID, and I use the 2009 data so that I get a baseline measure of the practice before the price shock takes effect). The purpose of this code is to first merge the price shock information into service-level quantity data, then construct the total increase in revenue from the price shock based on observed quantities (that’s the numer variable), and divide by the total hypothetical revenue if payments never changed. The resulting phy_rev_change is intended to measure the increase in revenue for a given physician relative to revenue without the price shock. Finally, I average this across all physicians in a practice based on their observed practice affiliation as of 2009 and multiply by the practice size (I really just sum the ratio, but that’s the same thing). The resulting practice_rev_change variable is what you should use as your instrument for \\(INT_{it}\\).\n\n  price.shock &lt;- medicare.puf %&gt;% inner_join(taxid.base, by=\"npi\") %&gt;%\n    inner_join(pfs.yearly %&gt;% \n                 select(hcpcs, dprice_rel_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2007), \n               by=c(\"hcpcs_code\"=\"hcpcs\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate_at(vars(dprice_rel_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2007), replace_na, 0) %&gt;%\n    mutate(price_shock = case_when(\n            i&lt;=2013 ~ ((i-2009)/4)*dprice_rel_2010,\n            i&gt;2013  ~ dprice_rel_2010),\n          denom = line_srvc_cnt*price_nonfac_orig_2010,\n          numer = price_shock*line_srvc_cnt*price_nonfac_orig_2010) %&gt;%\n    group_by(npi) %&gt;%\n    summarize(phy_numer=sum(numer, na.rm=TRUE), phy_denom=sum(denom, na.rm=TRUE), tax_id=first(tax_id)) %&gt;%\n    ungroup() %&gt;%\n    mutate(phy_rev_change=phy_numer/phy_denom) %&gt;%    \n    group_by(tax_id) %&gt;%\n    summarize(practice_rev_change=sum(phy_rev_change, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n\nYes, the idea of summing a ratio is a bit odd. But it’s easier to think of the instrument as the product of baseline (pre-shock) practice size and the average relative revenue change due to the price shock. In that context, the sum of the ratio is really just an interaction term that incorporates information on the price shock magnitude and baseline practice size. Each of these things alone are poor instruments, but together for the practice it reflects a “better” instrument.\n\nAssess the “need” for IV by implementing a Durbin-Wu-Hausman test with an augmented regression. Do this by first estimating the regression, \\(INT_{it} = \\lambda \\Delta P_{it} + \\beta x_{it} + \\gamma_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\varepsilon_{it}\\), take the residual \\(\\hat{\\nu} = INT_{it} - \\hat{INT}_{it}\\), and run the regression \\[y_{it} = \\delta INT_{it} + \\beta x_{it} + \\gamma_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\kappa \\hat{\\nu} + \\varepsilon_{it}.\\] Discuss your results for \\(\\hat{\\kappa}\\).\nNow let’s pay attention to potential issues of weak instruments. As we discussed in class, one issue with weak instruments is that our typical critical values (say, 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval) from the equation of interest (sometimes called the structural equation) are too low in the presence of a weak first-stage. These issues are presented very clearly and more formally in the Andrews, Stock, and Sun (2019) survey article. For this question, you will consider two forms of inference in the presence of weak instruments. Hint: Check out the ivmodel package in R or the ivreg2 command in Stata for help getting the AR Wald statistic.\n\nPresent the results of a test of the null, \\(H_{0}: \\delta=0\\), using the Anderson-Rubin Wald statistic. Do your conclusions from this test differ from a traditional t-test following 2SLS estimation of Equation @ref(eq:ols)?\nGoing back to your 2SLS results…inflate your 2SLS standard errors to form the \\(tF\\) adjusted standard error, following Table 3 in Lee et al. (2021). Repeat the test of the null, \\(H_{0}: \\delta=0\\), using standard critical values and the \\(tF\\) adjusted standard error.\n\nFollowing the Borusyak and Hull (2021) working paper (BH), we can consider our instrument as a function of some exogenous policy shocks and some possibly endogenous physician characteristics, \\(\\Delta P_{it}=f\\left(g_{pt}; z_{ipt}\\right)\\), where \\(g_{pt}\\) captures overall payment shocks for procedure \\(p\\) at time \\(t\\), and \\(z_{ip}\\) denotes a physician’s quantity of different procedures at baseline. We can implement the BH re-centering approach as follows:\n\nConsider hypothetical price changes over a set of possible counterfactuals by assuming that the counterfactuals consist of different allocations of the observed relative price changes. For example, take the vector of all relative price changes, reallocate this vector randomly, and assign new hypothetical relative price changes. Do this 100 times. This isn’t “all” possible counterfactuals by any means, but it will be fine for our purposes.\nConstruct the expected revenue change over all possible realizations from previously, \\(\\mu_{it} = E [\\Delta P_{it}]= \\sum_{s=1}^{100} \\sum_{p} g_{pt}^{s} z_{ip}\\).\nRe-estimate Equation @ref(eq:ols) by 2SLS when instrumenting for \\(INT_{it}\\) with \\(\\tilde{\\Delta} P_{it} = \\Delta P_{it} - \\mu_{it}\\). Intuitively, this re-centering should isolate variation in the instrument that is only due to the policy and remove variation in our instrument that is due to physician practice styles (the latter of which is not a great instrument).\n\nDiscuss your findings and compare estimates from different estimators.\nReflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging? What did you find most surprising?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAltonji, Joseph G, Todd E Elder, and Christopher R Taber. 2005. “An Evaluation of Instrumental Variable Strategies for Estimating the Effects of Catholic Schooling.” Journal of Human Resources 40 (4): 791–821.\n\n\nLee, David S., Justin McCrary, Marcelo J.

Info and code for these data are available at my GitHub page here. The raw data are available in our class OneDrive folder. Use these data for information on total discharges and to construct a measure of hospital prices.\nHospital Market GitHub Repo: John Graves has an excellent GitHub repository detailing the issues in measuring hospital markets. You can access that repo here. To replicate some of his work using the community detection algorithm, you’ll need to use the Hospital Service Area Files. The link takes you to the CMS website where you can download the data directly. For a condensed version of the code focusing more on the market formation rather than mapping, see my GitHub repo here.\n\nBut given the time crunch of the semester and the complexity of some of the raw data work for this assignment, I’m going to try to give you all a break here by skipping some steps for you. In our OneDrive folder, you’ll find the ‘hospital_markets.txt’ data, which is the data output from the hospital market github repo. I’ve also uploaded a couple of other geographic data files to give you info on HRR, zip, and fips.\n\n\nQuestions\nIn your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions. In all cases, limit your data to the years 2000 through 2017.\n\nCalculate hospital market shares when defining the “market” by zip code and using hospital discharges as your measure of quantity. Plot the distribution of market shares over time (e.g., with a box plot or a violin plot).\nStill using zip codes as your definition of the market, provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between market concentration and price by estimating a linear regression of the following: \\[p_{ht} = \\beta HHI_{m(h)t} + \\lambda x_{ht} + \\theta z_{m(h)t} + \\gamma_{h} + \\gamma_{t} + \\varepsilon_{ht},\\] where \\(p_{ht}\\) denotes the estimated price for hospital \\(h\\) at time \\(t\\), \\(HHI_{m(h)t}\\) denotes market concentration, \\(x_{ht}\\) denotes time-varying hospital characteristics, \\(z_{m(h)t}\\) denotes time-varying market characteristics, and \\(\\gamma_{h}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{t}\\) denote hospital and time fixed effects.\nCalculate hospital market shares when defining the “market” as the HRR, again using hospital discharges as your measure of quantity. Plot the distribution of market shares over time. How do these results differ from part 1?\nStill using HRR as your definition of the market, provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between market concentration and price by estimating the same linear regression from part (2), but now with HRR as your definition of the market.\nCalculate hospital market shares when defining the market based on the community detection algorithms described here. Continue to use hospital discharges as your measure of quantity, and again provide a plot of market shares over time. How do these results differ from those in parts 1 and 3?\nUsing your community detection measure of markets, provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between market concentration and price by estimating the same linear regression from part (2), but with your new market definition.\nEstimate a logit discrete choice model using market share data based on the different definition of markets in parts 1, 3, and 5. Be sure to include year and hospital fixed effects in your estimation. What is your price elasticity estimate in each case, and how does it differ based on your measure of the market? hint: don’t worry about instrumenting for anything right now.\nDiscuss your findings and compare results from different market definitions. Also compare your descriptive evidence from what you find in the share-based discrete choice model.\nReflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging? What did you find most surprising?\nPlease write a couple of sentences about the course. What would you change about the class? What content would you remove or add?

Once you’ve identified your papers, note your paper title, authors, your name, and the date of your presentation on the Presentations tab of the Google Sheet here no later than Friday, January 26.\nWe will have no more than four paper groupings per class day, which means we have to keep each presentation plus discussion to no more than 20 minutes. We’ll have a few extra minutes on days with just three paper groupings, but even on those days, let’s aim for 20 minutes. The presentation should follow a standard conference setup, with some brief discussion of the research question, discussion of the data, empirical analysis, and results and key contributions. You should also prepare two discussion questions to lead a 5 minute discussion after your presentation. Please submit your presentations via Canvas no later than 11:59pm on the day before your presentation.\nYour presentation should be no more than 10 slides (including a title slide and your discussion questions at the end). Since the papers have already been motivated from prior classes, you can safely ignore the “motivation” section of a typical presentation.

Please conclude your presentation with a final slide listing these questions.\n\nNote that a presentation is not just a re-hashing of the paper in slide form. A good academic presentation should have as little information as possible on each slide, and the content on the slides doesn’t necessarily need to follow that of the paper.

    "text": "The research proposal is a starting point for a research project. It’s a basic structure that can help you think through specific aspects of a new project and begin to assess its viability and its potential contribution. For our purposes, a research proposal should consist of a two-page report and a 10-15 minute presentation addressing the following four points:\n\nWhat is your research question?\nThis should be formulated as an input-output question, e.g., I’m interested in studying the effects of T on Y, or I’m interested in understanding the association between X and Y. While there are many types of research questions, in general your question should satisfy three key criteria (adapted from Jesse Shapiro’s “Four Steps to an Applied Micro Paper”)\n\nThe question has an answer. We may not know what the answer is, but we can agree that an answer exists. “What is the effect on quantity sold of imposing a price ceiling on ketchup?” has an answer. “What is the nature of firm and consumer behavior in the ketchup industry?” does not.\nThe answer is not obvious. We cannot readily determine the answer to the question based on logic, common sense, or existing evidence. “Would making ketchup available only on Tuesdays improve consumer welfare?” has an answer, but we can probably guess what it is.\nThe answer is actionable. If we knew the answer, someone (say, a policymaker, firm, or NGO) might care to do things differently. “What is the effect on consumer welfare of imposing uniform wholesale pricing on the ketchup market?” seems actionable, because in fact ketchup is subject to uniform wholesale pricing restrictions in the US, and a policymaker might be interested to know whether such restrictions are a good idea. “What is the effect on consumer welfare of a technology that instantly transports ketchup to your fries whenever you need it?” seems more hypothetical.\n\n\n\nWhat is the hook?\nWhy is your question important and relevant? This should be aimed at a general audience, not someone specific to your field and perhaps not even to an economist.\n\n\nWhat is your economic model?\nYour research question should be specific enough so that you are able to write down a model, an equation, or a series of equations that would facilitate answering this question. The model is not simply a mathematical representation of your research question. Rather, it should help inform the empirical methods and variation you will be using.\n\n\nWhat is the data and source of variation used for identification?\nYou must provide a detailed description of the data that you plan to use to estimate the model and answer the research question. This must include a discussion of where the variation in the data is coming from, why is it credible, and how it maps onto the research question. You don’t need to have the data yet, but you need to know it exists and how to access it. The data must also be accessible in a reasonable time period. Course instructors are expected to verify the existence and feasibility of obtaining the data."

(2021) and Richards, Seward, and Whaley (2022)\nEach of these papers link physician agency with policy questions in healthcare, focusing on the increasing role of hospital employment of physicians.\n\n\nSingh (2024)\nThis paper also looks at the role of physician agency and organizational structure, focusing on the role of private equity acquisitions.\n\n\nZeltzer (2020) and Agha et al. (2022)\nThese papers each speak to physician agency and referrals. Agha et al. (2022) considers the consequences of different referral network structures for PCPs, and Zeltzer (2020) considers the creation of referral networks themselves with implications for how these networks are shaped by physician agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAgha, Leila, Keith Marzilli Ericson, Kimberley H.

There are certainly more than two areas of active research in the study of health insurance, but these are two that I think are particularly important to understand.\n\nHealth Insurance Design and Consumer Behavior: The design of health insurance plans (like copayments, deductibles, and coverage decisions) directly affects consumer choices and healthcare utilization. This area is crucial for policy design, ensuring that insurance structures meet both economic efficiency and equity goals. We’ll discuss Brown and Jeon (n.d.) and Ho and Lee (2020) as an example of this line of current/future research.\nInnovation/Technology Adoption and Health Insurance: In affecting how services are paid for, insurance can also affect the adoption of new technologies and innovations in healthcare. We’ll discuss Garthwaite (2012) and Agha, Kim, and Li (2022) as examples of this line of work.\nHealth Insurance Networks: The structure of health insurance networks can affect the quality of care that patients receive. We’ll briefly discuss Gruber and McKnight (2016) as an example of this line of work, even though it is a little bit older for “current/future” research, and we’ll discuss Kreider et al.

    "text": "The more recent literature in health insurance tends to consider more indirect effects of health insurance, such as reductions in payment delinquency in other areas (non-healthcare spending) or effects of health insurance on provider behaviors. There is also a recent literature concerned with how to improve the quality of an enrollee’s health insurance plan, which draws heavily on earlier studies of health insurance demand but focuses on more current policy issues such as administrative barriers, default plan selections, etc. For this class, we’ll focus on the following papers:\n\nHu et al. (2018)\nThis paper examines the financial impacts of the Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The authors use credit report data and a difference-in-differences strategy to analyze the financial outcomes for individuals in states that expanded Medicaid compared to those in states that did not. They find that ACA Medicaid expansions led to significant reductions in the amount of unpaid bills, the amount of debt in collections, and the credit scores of individuals who gained Medicaid coverage. The reductions in unpaid bills and debts were primarily driven by decreases in medical debts, but not exclusively.\n\n\nFinkelstein (2007) and Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2019)\nI lump these papers together because they both speak to effects of health insurance beyond an individual patient or enrollee. Finkelstein (2007) examines the broader economic impacts of the introduction of Medicare in the U.S. She finds that the introduction of Medicare led to a significant increase in hospital spending, responsible for a substantial portion of the 37 percent increase in hospital spending between 1965 and 1970. They also discuss how the increased spending due to Medicare led to rapid growth in the healthcare sector, influencing not only healthcare delivery but also labor markets and infrastructure within the sector. The paper underscores the need to consider both direct and indirect effects of large scale policies such as Medicare.\nFinkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2019) considers the value of Medicaid coverage using the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. The study estimates that low-income uninsured adults’ willingness to pay for Medicaid ranges from $0.5 to $1.2 per dollar of the resource cost of providing Medicaid. The authors show that 60% of Medicaid’s gross expenditures, or $3600 per recipient, are essentially transfers to parties who would otherwise subsidize medical care for the low-income uninsured, leaving the net cost of Medicaid at about $1450 per recipient. The paper concludes that Medicaid serves dual roles: as a monetary transfer to external parties and as a subsidized insurance product for recipients, with recipient willingness to pay for Medicaid significantly below its gross cost​.\n\n\nBrot-Goldberg et al. (2023)\nThis paper leverages two natural experiments to study the impact of default options in public drug insurance for low-income elderly in the U.S. The study finds that default plan selections significantly influence plan enrollment and drug utilization, with 96% of beneficiaries following an exogenously changed default. The paper proposes a general framework for choice under costly cognition, suggesting that both paternalistic defaults (steering consumers to suitable plans) and ‘shocking’ defaults (triggering active choices) could be optimal, depending on a key parameter: the elasticity of active choice propensity relative to the default value. However, they find this elasticity to be close to zero, indicating minimal active choice difference between beneficiaries assigned to well-matched vs. poorly-matched defaults. The study also shows that poorly-matched defaults lead to significant declines in drug consumption, suggesting that the welfare losses from following these defaults likely outweigh any potential gains from induced active choices. A third natural experiment reveals that the limited active choice observed seems largely random, driven by transient attentional shifts within beneficiaries. The results highlight the importance of paternalistic defaults in insurance market design, likely benefiting beneficiaries more than harming them.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrot-Goldberg, Zarek, Timothy Layton, Boris Vabson, and Adelina Yanyue Wang. 2023. “The Behavioral Foundations of Default Effects: Theory and Evidence from Medicare Part D.” American Economic Review 113 (10): 2718–58. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20210013.\n\n\nFinkelstein, Amy. 2007. “The Aggregate Effects of Health Insurance: Evidence from the Introduction of Medicare.” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 122 (1): 1–37. https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.122.1.1.\n\n\nFinkelstein, Amy, Nathaniel Hendren, and Erzo F.

These questions are not exhaustive, but they provide a starting point for understanding the current state of research in health insurance and identifying gaps in the literature.\n\nPolicies for Expanding Health Insurance Access and Affordability: In light of the debates around healthcare reform, there’s a pressing need to evaluate which policies are most effective in expanding access to and affordability of health insurance. Understanding the welfare consequences of these policies helps inform decisions that could impact millions of lives. We’ll discuss Geddes and Schnell (2023) and Curto (2023) as examples of this type of ongoing research.\nPublic vs Private Health Insurance There is growing interest concerning the effects of privatizing an otherwise public health insurance program. This is particularly important as we continue to consider the increasing privatization in public insurance such as Medicaid Managed Care and Medicare Advantage. We’ll discuss Layton et al.

The paper challenges conventional views on market competition and monopoly in the context of insurance, offering a novel perspective that complements and extends the literature developed by B. R. Handel (2013), B. Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2015), and B. R. Handel, Kolstad, and Spinnewijn (2019), among otherse.\n\n\nShepard (2022)\nThis paper considers the interplay between hospital network competition and adverse selection, focusing on the Massachusetts health insurance exchange. The authors advance the literature on health insurance markets by introducing the concept of hospital network competition into the discussion of adverse selection. Traditionally, studies have focused on premiums, plan benefits, and individual consumer attributes in analyzing adverse selection. This paper broadens this perspective by showing that the networks of hospitals associated with insurance plans are also crucial in shaping consumer behavior and the overall dynamics of adverse selection in the market. This novel approach enriches the understanding of the multifaceted nature of health insurance markets and highlights the importance of considering a broader range of factors in studying these markets.\n\n\nCabral, Geruso, and Mahoney (2018) and Curto et al. (2021)\nThese papers advance our understanding of managed competition. Cabral, Geruso, and Mahoney (2018) cautions against the assumption that increased subsidies will directly benefit consumers, emphasizing the need for careful design and regulation of subsidy mechanisms, and Curto et al. (2021) examines the potential for competition to improve consumer outcomes in these markets. Both papers underscore the importance of balancing market forces with effective regulation to achieve the goals of managed competition in government-sponsored health insurance programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCabral, Marika, Michael Geruso, and Neale Mahoney. 2018. “Do Larger Health Insurance Subsidies Benefit Patients or Producers?

Today we’ll spend some time talking about the structure of the class, the assignments, grading, etc. We’ll also navigate the website for a bit just to make sure we can get around and understand where different information is. But before we do that, I want to spend some time motivating the area of health economics and why I think this is a critical area of study for economists.\nWe’ll discuss more details in class, but the basic idea is:\n\nHealthcare is an extremely complicated market, particularly in the U.S., and the sources of complexity reflect a unique combination of common economic issues. Some of they key issues (highlighted 60 years ago in Arrow (1963)!) include uncertainty in need for medical care, the “experience” nature of the good that makes it difficult to ascertain quality and price in advance, information asymmetry (between patients and physicians, and between patients and insurers), the distortionary effects of insurance, licensing and regulation, as well as professional norms and non-standard objective functions.\nDue to its complexity, healthcare is extremely expensive (this is true almost everywhere, but again, especially in the U.S.) and constitutes a large share of GDP\nBecause of its expense and complexity, healthcare plays a major role in public finance, labor markets, and inequality\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nArrow, Kenneth J. 1963. “Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care.” The American Economics Review 53 (5). https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/53.5.941-973.pdf."

    "text": "In explaining why we spend so much money on healthcare in the U.S., Uwe Reinhardt famously said, “It’s the prices, stupid.” The spirit of his comment is that, while people will try to cite lots of reasons for high healthcare spending (such as physician salaries, profit incentives, poorer health of U.S. population relative to other countries, overuse of healthcare, fraud, etc.), these things really aren’t big factors relative to price differences. Essentially, if we want to really address healthcare spending, we need to place downward pressure on prices. With that in mind, Module 3 covers pricing and competition in healthcare.\nThe observation that prices in healthcare care are high is not new. It’s been a problem for decades. Some good surveys of this problem and suggestions to improve competitiveness in healthcare include: Dranove and Satterthwaite (2000), M. Gaynor and Vogt (2000), Martin Gaynor and Vogt (2003), M.
