We will focus on the following areas: health insurance, physician agency, healthcare pricing and competition, information disclosure, physician learning, and healthcare waste. As we cover some of the key papers in these areas, we will discuss and employ tools from the fields of empirical IO and causal inference. These methods will be discuseed as needed throughout the course, but students are expected to have a working knowledge of these methods prior to the start of the course.\nSupply-side health economics is a rapidly growing field with many new developments, particularly in the areas of bargaining in two-sided markets, information disclosure, and physician learning. Some of these recent developments use tools from network analysis and machine learning, which we unfortunately do not have time to cover in this course. I’ve also chosen specific topics that overlap most with my own research — the upside here is that I can speak somewhat confidently about the literature and empirical studies in this area, but the downside is that some very interesting areas of health economics are not studied. For example, we will largely ignore issues of the prescription drug market, medical devices, and physician labor supply. My hope is that the content that we do cover will provide a springboard for those interested in these other important areas."

    "text": "Text, Software, and Class Materials\n\nReadings: As an elective PhD course, we will rely on academic papers from the reading list in each module. I expect everyone to read the papers in advance and come to class with questions on the study’s contribution, empirical techniques, identification strategies, and datasets used. My goal with each paper is to discuss the analysis in as much detail as possible within our time constraints. As such, we’ll focus on relatively fewer papers in class. I’ve provided a more comprehensive reading list in each module for those interested in additional readings in a specific area.\nSoftware: For anything data related, I’ll use R, but you are free to use whatever software you’re most comfortable with in your empirical work. I encourage you to use R, Stata, or Python simply because these are the most common programs used in practice right now. You’ll also need to have a basic working knowledge of Git and GitHub. If you’re new to these tools, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R.\nLogistics: For day-to-day communication, grades, and other private information (such as Zoom meeting links if needed), I’ll use Canvas. I’ll post all other materials to our class website. Please be sure to set up you Canvas alerts so that you receive class announcements in a timely manner.\nSlides and Notes: Any presentations will be made available on our class website prior to any given class."

    "text": "Course policies\nVarious policies for this course are described below. Basically, let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe Emory University Honor Code is taken seriously and governs all work in this course. Details about the Honor Code are available in the Laney Graduate School Handbook and available online here. By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to plagiarize, to deviate from the instructions about collaboration on work that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You also affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to report them to the honor council.\n\n\nAccessibility services\nIf you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at accessibility@emory.edu. To register with OAS, students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS office.\n\n\nCommunication\nI will post regular announcements to the class on Canvas, so please set up your notifications on Canvas accordingly. I will also use Canvas to post all grades and any other information that needs to stay in the class (like our Zoom meeting link for virtual meetings, if needed). All other course materials will be available on our class website, econ771s24.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com/.\nPlease feel free to reach out to me for any reason. I generally respond to all e-mails within 24 hours.\n\n\nOffice Hours\nMy designated office hours are 1:30-2:15pm on Monday and Wednesday in R432 of the R. Randall Rollins building. I’m happy to meet outside of normal office hours as well. Please feel free to schedule another time to meet by following the link to select a time that works for you, https://mccarthy-meetings.youcanbook.me. Unless otherwise noted, all meetings will be held in my office. If you need to meet virtually, please let me know and I’ll send you a Zoom link.\n\n\nAttendance\nWhile there is no official “attendance” credit, everyone is expected to attend all class sessions. Given our small class, it is very important that we are all present and engaged."

    "section": "Assignments and Grading",
    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nThere are four main assignments throughout the semester. I describe each assignment below, with more detail provided on our assignments page.\n\nResearch Proposals\nYou will submit four research proposals throughout the semester. These are short, 1-2 page documents that outline a problem/motivation, a related research question, potential data to help answer this question, and a proposed empirical strategy. The goal of these proposals is to help you develop your own research ideas and to get feedback from me and your classmates. You will submit one proposal roughly every 3 weeks and present the proposal to the class. After you’ve presented and received feedback on four proposals, you will develop the best of these proposals into a more complete research plan. Details of the research proposal and plans are available on the assignments page of our class website.\nPlease select a date to present your research proposals on the Proposals tab of the Google Sheet here no later than Friday, January 26. Note that even though the presentations are spread out over three weeks for each proposal, everyone has the same due date.\n\n\nPresentations\nYou will present four papers throughout the course of the semester. Please note your selected papers and class dates on the Presentations tab of the Google Sheet here no later than Friday, January 26. If you do not select papers by then, I will assign you papers randomly. The list of potential papers to present and details of the expectations for each presentation are available on the assignments page of our class website.\n\n\nEmpirical Exercises\nThere is an applied component of this course where we spend some time with a real-life causal inference question. These will require some of your time outside of class to get the data in working order and implement the relevant identification strategy and econometric estimator. Raw data for each exercise will be provided on our class OneDrive notebook, the link to which is on Canvas. There are four possible empirical exercises, from which you must choose one. Please note your selection paper on the Exercises tab of the Google Sheet here no later than February 2.\n\n\nImportant Deadlines\nThis section is just to highlight important dates for assignments throughout the semester. Note that late assignments will receive an automatic 5% reduction in the grade for each day the assignment is turned in after the due date.\n\nSelect Papers to Present no later than January 26: Note the papers you plan to present on the Presentations tab of the Google Sheet here. Only one student per paper, so this is first-come first-served. Remember you need to select four papers to present throughout the semester. Please spread these presentations out over the semester.\nSelect Research Proposal Presentation Dates no later than January 26: Note the dates you plan to present your proposals on the Proposals tab of the Google Sheet here. Only two students can present on any given Friday.\nSelect Empirical Exercise no later than February 2: Note your selection on the Exercises tab of the Google Sheet here. No more than two students per exercise.\nThe first round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on February 2\nThe second round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on February 23\nThe third round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on March 22\nThe fourth and final round of Research Proposals and Presentations is due by class time on April 12\nEmpirical Exercises are due on April 26\nFinal Research Plans are due on April 29"

    "text": "For today’s class, we’re going to talk more specifically about fraud and overuse. While we tend to think of “fraud” as outright illegal activity, such as billing for services that were never provided, there are many other ways that providers can “game” the system to increase their revenue. These are also often classified as fraud, even though they may not be illegal. We’ll cover the following areas and papers in this class.\n\nUpcoding from Providers\nDafny and Gruber (2005) explores the reactions of hospitals to varying price structures in the healthcare market, particularly the extent to which hospitals adjust service volume, quality, and variety in response to changes in reimbursement rates. The study is an excellent example of how hospitals can adjust their behavior to maximize revenue, even when they are not engaging in outright fraud.\n\n\nUpcoding from Insurers\nGeruso and Layton (2020) investigates the phenomenon of upcoding in Medicare Advantage, examining how Medicare’s risk adjustment process may inadvertently incentivize this behavior. Again, this is an excellent example of overuse (or perhaps more accurately, overspending) that is not necessarily illegal but nonetheless a big driver of inefficiency.\n\n\nLearning about Fraud\nO’Malley, Bubolz, and Skinner (2021) examines the spread of fraudulent Medicare home health care billing in the U.S. from 2002-2016, focusing on the role of patient-sharing networks among healthcare agencies in propagating these fraudulent practices. Utilizing a novel bipartite mixture network index, the study finds a significant relationship between these networks and the diffusion of healthcare fraud. This research contributes to health economics by offering a deeper understanding of the structural aspects influencing healthcare fraud, highlighting the need for more targeted policy interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDafny, Leemore, and Jonathan Gruber. 2005. “Public Insurance and Child Hospitalizations: Access and Efficiency Effects.” Journal of Public Economics, Tax and Transfer Programs for Low-Income People, 89 (1): 109–29. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2003.05.004.\n\n\nGeruso, Michael, and Timothy Layton. 2020. “Upcoding: Evidence from Medicare on Squishy Risk Adjustment.” Journal of Political Economy 128 (3): 984–1026.\n\n\nO’Malley, A.

    "title": "Learning by Doing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Physician “learning by doing” specifically refers to the acquisition of expertise and improvement in clinical skills that occur through direct patient care. This contrasts with other forms of physician learning covered previously, as it involves a process of personal skill development and decision-making refinement that occurs over time as a result of repeated practice and exposure to a variety of clinical situations. We’ll discuss the following topics and papers for today’s class:\n\nBias and Priors\nComin, Skinner, and Staiger (2022) examines the role of perceived versus actual skill in the adoption of new medical technologies, specifically implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). It introduces a Bayesian framework that contrasts the use of technology based on perceived skill against the outcomes dependent on actual skill. This model is applied to study variations in ICD adoption across hospitals from 2002 to 2013, finding that perception bias accounts for a significant portion of the adoption rate differences. Importantly, the study highlights how learning about this bias in perception can accurately predict declines in technology use, suggesting that overconfidence in perceived skill plays a crucial role in technology adoption decisions in healthcare​.\n\n\nSkill Accumulation\nGong (2018) combines two important dimensions of learning: Bayesian learning, in which the physician updates beliefs about treatment effectiveness for different patients, and learning by doing, which enhances surgical skills. A dynamic structural model is developed and estimated, focusing on the context of brain aneurysm treamtent. The paper contributes to the learning literature by quantifying how “learning by doing” and Bayesian updating shape treatment choices, offering insights into how these learning mechanisms affect the diffusion of new medical technologies and treatment success​.\n\n\nLearning Failures\nOf course, there is no guarantee that physicians learn much from experience. Singh (2021) considers this in the context of negative outcomes following childbirth. She finds that, instead of making each delivery decision based on evidence and individual patient circumstances, doctors are influenced by the outcomes of their immediately preceding cases. This reliance on heuristics, particularly following complications in a prior delivery, represents a deviation from evidence-based decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nComin, Diego A., Jonathan S.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The bulk of the early literature on physician learning considers the case of a physician who is myopic, in the sense that they do not consider the impact of their actions on future patients. We’ll focus on the following areas and papers:\n\nLearning with Spillovers\nIn the context of prescription drugs, the simplest learning model considers a single agent learning about the best drug based on their experience with that drug. But in a prescription drug setting, physicians can learn about drugs based on their experience with other patients. We’ll discuss Coscelli and Shum (2004) as an example of this work. In that paper, the authors incorporate a more comprehensive learning model that allows for spillovers across all patients of a given doctor, as well as heterogeneity in patient informativeness. This approach is particularly relevant for pharmaceutical markets, where prescription drugs are often used for multiple diagnoses. The paper extends existing literature by using micro-data to quantify network-type spillovers across patients belonging to the same doctor, a significant contribution to the literature on physician learning. This model helps in understanding how doctors update their beliefs and make prescribing decisions based on the experiences of their patients with new medications, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of new drug entry in the market​\n\n\nLearning from Others\nWhile most models consider learning based on the individual’s own experience, physicians also learn from many other sources. We’ll discuss Chandra and Staiger (2007) and Agha and Molitor (2018) as examples of such learning, the first of which examines learning from peers and the second considers learning from new research trials.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAgha, Leila, and David Molitor. 2018. “THE LOCAL INFLUENCE OF PIONEER INVESTIGATORS ON TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION: EVIDENCE FROM NEW CANCER DRUGS.” The Review of Economics and Statistics 100 (1): 29–44. https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00670.\n\n\nChandra, Amitabh, and Douglas O.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We often think of the effects of information on patient choice, but information can also affect provider behavior. In the context of quality information, we can think of two channels through which information can affect provider behavior. First, information can affect the behavior of providers in the market in which the information is released. Second, information can affect the behavior of providers in markets to which patients are referred. More generally, there are general equilibrium effects from information disclosure. We’ll discuss these areas in today’s class.\n\nResponse from Providers in Own-Quality\nKolstad (2013) considers how public reporting of individual surgeon performance impacts their work quality, focusing on intrinsic motivation factors. The study finds that while public reporting does not significantly alter overall performance, it leads to a modest improvement in the performance of surgeons at the lower end of the quality spectrum. This suggests that the intrinsic motivation to maintain reputation and self-esteem, rather than external incentives, plays a key role in how surgeons respond to public performance data.\n\n\nResponse from Providers in Referrals\nEpstein (2010) examines the impact of publicly available surgeon report cards on the referral behavior of cardiologists. The authors find that cardiologists tend to refer patients to surgeons with better performance scores, indicating a significant influence of report cards on referral decisions. This shift in referral patterns underscores the role of report cards in guiding professional decision-making and potentially influencing the quality of patient care.\n\n\nEquilibrium Response\nBrown (2019) explores how the availability of price information in healthcare affects market equilibrium. The study finds that increased transparency in healthcare pricing leads to lower prices and higher quality of care, as providers compete on both price and quality dimensions. This suggests that price transparency can effectively influence healthcare market dynamics, benefiting consumers through more competitive and efficient healthcare options.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, Zach Y. 2019. “Equilibrium Effects of Health Care Price Information.” The Review of Economics and Statistics 101 (4): 699–712. https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00765.\n\n\nEpstein, Andrew J. 2010. “Effects of Report Cards on Referral Patterns to Cardiac Surgeons.” Journal of Health Economics 29 (5): 718–31. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2010.06.002.\n\n\nKolstad, Jonathan T. 2013. “Information and Quality When Motivation Is Intrinsic: Evidence from Surgeon Report Cards.” American Economic Review 103 (7): 2875–2910."

We’ll focus on the following areas and papers for today’s class.\n\nCompetition and Quality\nWhile most studies focus on the relationship between competition and price, there is a growing literature on the relationship between competition and quality. We’ll discuss Gaynor, Moreno-Serra, and Propper (2013) and Barker, Watt, and Tranmer (2022) as examples of work in this area.\n\n\nCompetition and Other Outcomess\nIn addition to prices and quality, competition can influence hospitals in many different ways. Eliason et al. (2020) studies mergers in the context of dialysis (effectively this is a study of market power and quality, they look at specific treatment decisions that happen to be negatively correlated with quality). Craig, Grennan, and Swanson (2021) studies the effect of mergers on bargaining power for high-price inputs (medicald devices, in this case).\n\n\nCompetition in Rural Settings\nIn the U.S., rural hospitals have struggled in recent years, with many hospitals closing. Understanding the effects of such closures and what we might want to do about it is an active area of policy interest. We’ll discuss Carroll et al. (2023) as a review of this clinical setting, and Fischer, Royer, and White (2024) as a recent paper in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBarker, Eliane H., Jenny Watt, and Joan Tranmer. 2022. “The Impact of Hospital Closures and Mergers on Patient Welfare.” {SSRN} {Scholarly} {Paper}.

    "text": "The goal for today’s class is to understand the literature on hospital pricing and different ways to estimate the effects of competition on prices. We’ll focus our discussion on the following topics and papers.\n\nPricing in ‘Structure-Conduct-Performance’ Studies\nMuch of the early work in empirical IO can be classified as “structure-conduct-performance” studies. Such studies typically consider a summary measure of market structure (like HHI) and then estimate a relationship between that measure and prices. The literature has since moved beyond these types of studies, as discussed in Miller et al. (2022), but we need to know this literature exists before we move on. We’ll discuss Kessler and McClellan (2000) as an example of this type of work in healthcare, and we’ll dicuss Miller et al. (2022) as a general critique of the “structure-conduct-performance” approach.\n\n\nEffects of Mergers and Closures\nRather than attempting to measure competition, we can simply identify markets exposed to changes in competitiveness (e.g., mergers or closures) and try to estimate the effects of such changes. We’ll discuss Dafny (2009) as an example of this line of work.\n\n\nPricing and Bargaining\nThere are several papers that collectively develop structural models of bargaining that have become the standard in the literature at this point. We’ll focus on Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town (2015) as an example of this type of work. We’ve already covered Ho and Lee (2017) in our discussion of inusrance markets, which extends Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town (2015) to include bargaining between employers and insurers. We’ll also discuss Clemens and Gottlieb (2017), which doesn’t estimate a bargaining model but has implications for the potential role of bargaining to drive prices relative to other forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nClemens, Jeffrey, and Joshua D Gottlieb. 2017. “In the Shadow of a Giant: Medicare’s Influence on Private Physician Payments.” Journal of Political Economy 125 (1): 1–39.\n\n\nDafny, Leemore. 2009. “Estimation and Identification of Merger Effects: An Application to Hospital Mergers.” Journal of Law and Economics 52 (3): 523–50.\n\n\nGowrisankaran, Gautam, Aviv Nevo, and Robert Town. 2015. “Mergers When Prices Are Negotiated: Evidence from the Hospital Industry.” American Economic Review 105 (1): 172–203.\n\n\nHo, Kate, and Robin S Lee. 2017. “Insurer Competition in Health Care Markets.” Econometrica 85 (2): 379–417.\n\n\nKessler, Daniel, and Mark McClellan. 2000. “Is Hospital Competition Socially Wasteful?” Quarterly Journal of Economics 2 (115): 577–615.\n\n\nMiller, Nathan, Steven Berry, Fiona Scott Morton, Jonathan Baker, Timothy Bresnahan, Martin Gaynor, Richard Gilbert, et al. 2022. “On the Misuse of Regressions of Price on the HHI in Merger Review.” Journal of Antitrust Enforcement 10 (2): 248–59. https://doi.org/10.1093/jaenfo/jnac009."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The goal for today’s class is to understand the role of adverse selection in health insurance markets. Again, there is a lot of work in this space, and we can’t talk about everything! Focus areas and selected papers for this class are listed below.\n\nPricing and Adverse Selection\nOne of the fundamental barriers to an efficient health insurance market is adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when consumers with different risk profiles purchase different insurance plans. This can lead to a situation where the average cost of care for a given plan is higher than the average premium, which is not sustainable for insurers. This is a problem because it can lead to a situation where no insurer is willing to offer a plan at a price that consumers are willing to pay. We’ll discuss Bundorf, Levin, and Mahoney (2012) and Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2010) as examples of research inthis area. These papers discuss and implement some of the standard tools and current results in the study of health insurance premiums and adverse selection.\n\n\nMitigating Adverse Selection\nWhile the prior papers discuss the role of adverse selection on pricing, they don’t necessarily offer any explicit solutions to the adverse selection problem. We’ll discuss B. R. Handel (2013), B. Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2015), and B. R. Handel, Kolstad, and Spinnewijn (2019) as examples of papers that consider adverse selection and potential unintended consequences of policy interventions. The papers demonstrate that while adverse selection is a fundamental challenge in health insurance markets, its manifestations and solutions are diverse and complex.\n\n\nAdverse Selection and Insurance Networks\nAgain on the area of adverse selection, we’ll discuss Shepard (2022) in class. This paper considers the interplay between hospital network competition and adverse selection, focusing on the Massachusetts health insurance exchange. The authors advance the literature on health insurance markets by introducing the concept of hospital network competition into the discussion of adverse selection. Traditionally, studies have focused on premiums, plan benefits, and individual consumer attributes in analyzing adverse selection. This paper broadens this perspective by showing that the networks of hospitals associated with insurance plans are also crucial in shaping consumer behavior and the overall dynamics of adverse selection in the market. This novel approach enriches the understanding of the multifaceted nature of health insurance markets and highlights the importance of considering a broader range of factors in studying these markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBundorf, M Kate, Jonathan Levin, and Neale Mahoney. 2012. “Pricing and Welfare in Health Plan Choice.” American Economic Review 102 (7): 3214–48.\n\n\nEinav, Liran, Amy Finkelstein, and Mark R.

    "title": "Effects of Health Insurance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The goal of today’s class is to study the effects of health insurance. In this general area, one topic that has been very well studied but that we won’t discuss much is the role of moral hazard in health insurance. This was part of our discussion in the last class, but for more details on that, see Einav and Finkelstein (2018). Focus areas and selected papers for this class are listed below.\n\nFinancial Effects of Health Insurance\nIn reducing the financial burden of healthcare costs, health insurance should relax a household’s budget constraint and reduce the probability of default on other financial obligations. This is an important consideration for policymakers, as it speaks to the broader economic impacts of health insurance. You’d think that this would be a more settled area of literature, but it has had surprisingly littler work done in this space.\nAs an example of this area of research, we’ll discuss Gross and Notowidigdo (2011) and Hu et al. (2018). Gross and Notowidigdo (2011) considers Medicaid expansions and bankruptices. Hu et al. (2018) similarly considers Medicaid expansions, but looks more generally at debt as their financial outcome. Both papers find that Medicaid expansions reduce financial hardship.\n\n\nHealth Effects of Health Insurance\nWhile it seems obvious to some, it’s not immediately clear that health insurance should improve health. We’ll discuss two papers that show strong evidence that health insurance does improve health. The first is Miller, Johnson, and Wherry (2021), which relates to Medicaid expansion. The second is Goldin, Lurie, and McCubbin (2021), which examines health insurance and mortality among non-Medicaid eligible adults. These are more recent papers, but that’s because only recently did we begin to get the proper data to answer this question definitively.\n\n\nHealth Insurance and Overall Welfare\nWhile health insurance clearly has direct effects on patients, it also has indirect effects on other parties, such as providers, employers, and taxpayers. These indirect effects are important to consider when evaluating the overall welfare effects of health insurance. Finkelstein (2007) and Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2019) are excellent examples of papers in this area.\nI lump these papers together because they both speak to effects of health insurance beyond an individual patient or enrollee. Finkelstein (2007) examines the broader economic impacts of the introduction of Medicare in the U.S. She finds that the introduction of Medicare led to a significant increase in hospital spending, responsible for a substantial portion of the 37 percent increase in hospital spending between 1965 and 1970. They also discuss how the increased spending due to Medicare led to rapid growth in the healthcare sector, influencing not only healthcare delivery but also labor markets and infrastructure within the sector. The paper underscores the need to consider both direct and indirect effects of large scale policies such as Medicare.\nFinkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2019) considers the value of Medicaid coverage using the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. The study estimates that low-income uninsured adults’ willingness to pay for Medicaid ranges from $0.5 to $1.2 per dollar of the resource cost of providing Medicaid. The authors show that 60% of Medicaid’s gross expenditures, or $3600 per recipient, are essentially transfers to parties who would otherwise subsidize medical care for the low-income uninsured, leaving the net cost of Medicaid at about $1450 per recipient. The paper concludes that Medicaid serves dual roles: as a monetary transfer to external parties and as a subsidized insurance product for recipients, with recipient willingness to pay for Medicaid significantly below its gross cost​.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEinav, Liran, and Amy Finkelstein. 2018. “Moral Hazard in Health Insurance: What We Know and How We Know It.” Journal of the European Economic Association 16 (4): 957–82. https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvy017.\n\n\nFinkelstein, Amy. 2007. “The Aggregate Effects of Health Insurance: Evidence from the Introduction of Medicare.” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 122 (1): 1–37. https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.122.1.1.\n\n\nFinkelstein, Amy, Nathaniel Hendren, and Erzo F.

    "text": "The research proposal is a starting point for a research project. It’s a basic structure that can help you think through specific aspects of a new project and begin to assess its viability and its potential contribution. Each proposal is worth 10 points toward your final grade, 8 points for the written proposal and 2 points for the presentation. The written proposal should be 2 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins, and the presentation should be 10-15 minutes and no more than 5 slides.\nYou’ll present four proposals thoughout the semester. Please pick dates for each proposal and sign up on the Proposals tab of the Google Sheet here by January 26. Note that you have to pick one date for each proposal, so you can really only choose between three days for each proposal. All written proposals and presentations are due via Canvas by the first due date in each block (2/2, 2/23, 3/22, and 4/12). So if you select 2/9 as your presentation date for the first proposal, you still have to submit your written proposal and presentation slides by 2/2. This is just to ensure a common due date for everyone.\nFor our purposes, a research proposal should consist of a two-page report and a 10-15 minute presentation addressing the following four points:\n\nWhat is your research question?\nThis should be formulated as an input-output question, e.g., I’m interested in studying the effects of T on Y, or I’m interested in understanding the association between X and Y. While there are many types of research questions, in general your question should satisfy three key criteria (adapted from Jesse Shapiro’s “Four Steps to an Applied Micro Paper”)\n\nThe question has an answer. We may not know what the answer is, but we can agree that an answer exists. “What is the effect on quantity sold of imposing a price ceiling on ketchup?” has an answer. “What is the nature of firm and consumer behavior in the ketchup industry?” does not.\nThe answer is not obvious. We cannot readily determine the answer to the question based on logic, common sense, or existing evidence. “Would making ketchup available only on Tuesdays improve consumer welfare?” has an answer, but we can probably guess what it is.\nThe answer is actionable. If we knew the answer, someone (say, a policymaker, firm, or NGO) might care to do things differently. “What is the effect on consumer welfare of imposing uniform wholesale pricing on the ketchup market?” seems actionable, because in fact ketchup is subject to uniform wholesale pricing restrictions in the US, and a policymaker might be interested to know whether such restrictions are a good idea. “What is the effect on consumer welfare of a technology that instantly transports ketchup to your fries whenever you need it?” seems more hypothetical.\n\n\n\nWhat is the hook?\nWhy is your question important and relevant? This should be aimed at a general audience, not someone specific to your field and perhaps not even to an economist.\n\n\nWhat is your economic model?\nYour research question should be specific enough so that you are able to write down a model, an equation, or a series of equations that would facilitate answering this question. The model is not simply a mathematical representation of your research question. Rather, it should help inform the empirical methods and variation you will be using.\n\n\nWhat is the data and source of variation used for identification?\nYou must provide a detailed description of the data that you plan to use to estimate the model and answer the research question. This must include a discussion of where the variation in the data is coming from, why is it credible, and how it maps onto the research question. You don’t need to have the data yet, but you need to know it exists and how to access it. The data must also be accessible in a reasonable time period. Course instructors are expected to verify the existence and feasibility of obtaining the data."

    "text": "Please review the class schedule and select four papers (or groups of papers) from the list of topics in each class, excluding any “background” classes. Your selections must also be on different dates. Once you’ve identified your papers, note your paper(s) title, authors, your name, and the date of your presentation on the Presentations tab of the Google Sheet here no later than Friday, January 26.\nWe will have no more than three paper groupings per class day, which means we have to keep each presentation plus discussion to no more than 25 minutes (20 for presentations, 5 for discussion). We’ll have a few extra minutes for discussion on days with just two paper groupings, but even on those days, let’s aim for 20 minute presentations. The presentation should follow a standard conference setup, with some brief discussion of the research question, discussion of the data, empirical analysis, and results and key contributions. You should also prepare two discussion questions to lead a 5 minute discussion after your presentation. Please submit your presentations via Canvas no later than 11:59pm on the day before your presentation.\nYour presentation should be no more than 10 slides (including a title slide and your discussion questions at the end). Since the papers have already been motivated from prior classes, you can safely ignore the “motivation” section of a typical presentation. Each presentation is worth 5 points toward your final grade, with one point allocated to each of the following categories:\n\nSlide length: no more than 10 slides in total (including your discussion questions)\nSlide layout: slides should be clear and concise, with no more than 5 lines of text per slide and at least one figure\nPresentation clarity: the presentation should be clear and well-organized, with a clear description of the research question, data, empirical analysis, and results\nPresentation length: the presentation should be no more than 20 minutes, including clarifying questions\nDiscussion questions: the discussion questions should be clear and thought-provoking. Please conclude your presentation with a final slide listing these questions.\n\nNote that a presentation is not just a re-hashing of the paper in slide form. A good academic presentation should have as little information as possible on each slide, and the content on the slides doesn’t necessarily need to follow that of the paper. For example, in a real-time environment, it is much easier to move between different aspects of the empirical analysis and data."

    "text": "Overview\nIn this exercise, we’re going to work through some applied issues related to measuring hospital markets and estimating demand with market-level data.\n\n\nResources and data\nThe data for this assignment comes from two sources:\n\nHospital Cost Report Information System: We used these data for assignment 1. Info and code for these data are available at my GitHub page here. The raw data are available in our class OneDrive folder. Use these data for information on total discharges and to construct a measure of hospital prices.\nHospital Market GitHub Repo: John Graves has an excellent GitHub repository detailing the issues in measuring hospital markets. You can access that repo here. To replicate some of his work using the community detection algorithm, you’ll need to use the Hospital Service Area Files. The link takes you to the CMS website where you can download the data directly. For a condensed version of the code focusing more on the market formation rather than mapping, see my GitHub repo here.\n\nBut given the time crunch of the semester and the complexity of some of the raw data work for this assignment, I’m going to try to give you all a break here by skipping some steps for you. In our OneDrive folder, you’ll find the ‘hospital_markets.txt’ data, which is the data output from the hospital market github repo. I’ve also uploaded a couple of other geographic data files to give you info on HRR, zip, and fips.\n\n\nQuestions\nIn your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions. In all cases, limit your data to the years 2000 through 2017.\n\nCalculate hospital market shares when defining the “market” by zip code and using hospital discharges as your measure of quantity. Plot the distribution of market shares over time (e.g., with a box plot or a violin plot).\nStill using zip codes as your definition of the market, provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between market concentration and price by estimating a linear regression of the following: \\[p_{ht} = \\beta HHI_{m(h)t} + \\lambda x_{ht} + \\theta z_{m(h)t} + \\gamma_{h} + \\gamma_{t} + \\varepsilon_{ht},\\] where \\(p_{ht}\\) denotes the estimated price for hospital \\(h\\) at time \\(t\\), \\(HHI_{m(h)t}\\) denotes market concentration, \\(x_{ht}\\) denotes time-varying hospital characteristics, \\(z_{m(h)t}\\) denotes time-varying market characteristics, and \\(\\gamma_{h}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{t}\\) denote hospital and time fixed effects.\nCalculate hospital market shares when defining the “market” as the HRR, again using hospital discharges as your measure of quantity. Plot the distribution of market shares over time. How do these results differ from part 1?\nStill using HRR as your definition of the market, provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between market concentration and price by estimating the same linear regression from part (2), but now with HRR as your definition of the market.\nCalculate hospital market shares when defining the market based on the community detection algorithms described here. Continue to use hospital discharges as your measure of quantity, and again provide a plot of market shares over time. How do these results differ from those in parts 1 and 3?\nUsing your community detection measure of markets, provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between market concentration and price by estimating the same linear regression from part (2), but with your new market definition.\nEstimate a logit discrete choice model using market share data based on the different definition of markets in parts 1, 3, and 5. Be sure to include year and hospital fixed effects in your estimation. What is your price elasticity estimate in each case, and how does it differ based on your measure of the market? hint: don’t worry about instrumenting for anything right now.\nDiscuss your findings and compare results from different market definitions. Also compare your descriptive evidence from what you find in the share-based discrete choice model.\nReflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging? What did you find most surprising?\nPlease write a couple of sentences about the course. What would you change about the class? What content would you remove or add?

    "title": "Exercise 2: Instrumental Variables",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn this assignment, we’re going to work through some applied issues related to instrumental variables. For a long time, IV (or 2SLS) was a very common identification strategy for applied empirical micro, but it fell out of favor as people became more aware of the assumptions underlying the estimator and better understood what IV actually estimates (not the ATE in most cases). People also started to find other strategies that were more compelling in some applications (and of course with some other assumptions). In this assignment, we’re going to study the effects of a physician’s affiliation with a hospital on physician practice patterns, and we’ll instrument for physician affiliation using some specific Medicare payment shocks.\n\n\nResources and data\nThe data for this assignment comes from three sources:\n\nMD-PPAS; The Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty includes data on physician specialties, practice IDs, demographics, and place of service. Be sure to follow the link and read the data documentation. We’ll use these data to construct a measure of physician integration.\nMedicare Utilization and Payment Data: These files provide data on the quantities and Medicare spending of each physician and service. We’ll use these data to capture total physician-level billing activity, and we’ll use the service-level data to measure the revenue effects from our plausibly exogenous policy shock. These data are only available beginning in 2012. These files are large but otherwise relatively clean and easy to use, so there’s no separate repo for these data. Note that we will only work with data for MDs, so you can drop a lot of observations with that restriction.\nPhysician Fee Schedule 2010 Update: Our instrument mainly consists of a shock to physician payments introduced in 2010. The shock further increased payments for services in an outpatient facility compared to services billed in a physician’s office. The GitHub repo (linked above) provides code to recreate a dataset with service-specific price shocks introduced by the 2010 fee schedule update. To save us some time, I’ve posed the final dataset from that repo into our class data folder.\n\n\n\nQuestions\nIn your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions. Note that our utilization and payment data only start in 2012 (just a limitation of using publicly available data), while the price shock first takes place in 2010. Thankfully, the price shock was introduced gradually from 2010 through 2013, so our instrument (see question 4 below) still has some variation over our time period. For all of this analysis, please focus only on the years from 2012 through 2017 and focus only on MDs (based on the “NPPES Credentials” field in the PUF data). Please use the raw values for your summary statistics, but you might consider using logs in the rest of the analysis due to the heavily skewed nature of the data.\n\nProvide and discuss a table of simple summary statistics showing the mean, standard deviation, min, and max of total physician-level Medicare spending, claims, and patients. Use the Medicare utilization and payment data to calculate total spending, claims, and patients at the physician level. You can do this using the average Medicare allowed amt * bene_day_srvc_cnt (or Medicare allowed amt * line_srvc_cnt) for spending, bene_day_srvc_cnt or the line_srvc_cnt for claims, and bene_unique_cnt for patients. The patient counts will include some overlap since the data are by service, but that’s OK for our purposes.\nForm a proxy for integration using the ratio: \\[\\begin{equation}\nINT_{it} = \\mathbf{1} \\left(\\frac{HOPD_{it}}{HOPD_{it} + OFFICE_{it} + ASC_{it}} \\geq 0.75\\right),\n(\\#eq:int)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(HOPD_{it}\\) reflects the total number of claims in which physician \\(i\\) bills in a hospital outpatient setting, \\(OFFICE_{it}\\) is the total number of claims billed to an office setting, and \\(ASC_{it}\\) is the total number of claims billed to an ambulatory surgery center. As reflected in Equation @ref(eq:int), you can assume that any physician with at least 75% of claims billed in an outpatient setting is integrated with a hospital. Using this 75% threshold, plot the mean of total physician-level claims for integrated versus non-integrated physicians over time.\nEstimate the relationship between integration on (log) total physician claims using OLS, with the following specification: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\delta INT_{it} + \\beta x_{it} + \\gamma_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\varepsilon_{it},\n(\\#eq:ols)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(INT_{it}\\) is defined in Equation @ref(eq:int), \\(x_{it}\\) captures time-varying physician characteristics, and \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{t}\\) denote physician and time fixed effects. Please focus on physician’s that weren’t yet integrated as of 2012, that way we have some pre-integration data for everyone. Impose this restriction for the remaining questions. Feel free to experiment with different covariates in \\(x_{it}\\) or simply omit that term and only include the fixed effects.\nHow much should we be “worried” about endogeneity here? Extending the work of Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005), Oster (2019) derives the expression \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\delta^{*} \\approx \\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}} - \\rho \\times \\left[\\hat{\\delta}_{D} - \\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}}\\right] \\times \\frac{R_{max}^{2} - R_{D,x_{1}}^{2}}{R_{D,x_{1}}^{2} - R_{D}^{2}} \\xrightarrow{p} \\delta,\n(\\#eq:oster)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(x_{1}\\) captures our observable covariates (or fixed effects in our case); \\(\\delta\\) denotes the treatment effect of interest; \\(\\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}}\\) denotes the coefficient on \\(D\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(D\\) and \\(x_{1}\\); \\(R_{D,x_{1}}^{2}\\) denotes the \\(R^{2}\\) from that regression; \\(\\hat{\\delta}_{D}\\) denotes the coefficient on \\(D\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(D\\) only; \\(R_{D}^{2}\\) reflects the \\(R^{2}\\) from that regression; \\(R_{max}^{2}\\) denotes an unobserved “maximum” \\(R^{2}\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(D\\), observed covariates \\(x_{1}\\), and some unobserved covariates \\(x_{2}\\); and \\(\\rho\\) denotes the degree of selection on observed variables relative to unobserved variables. One approach that Oster suggests is to consider a range of \\(R^{2}_{max}\\) and \\(\\rho\\) to bound the estimated treatment effect, where the bounds are given by \\(\\left[ \\hat{\\delta}_{D,x_{1}}, \\delta^{*}(R^{2}_{max}, \\rho) \\right]\\). Construct these bounds based on all combinations of \\(\\rho \\in (0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2)\\) and \\(R_{max}^{2} \\in (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1)\\) and present your results in a table. What do your results say about the extent to which selection on observables could be problematic here? Hint: you can also look into psacalc in Stata or robomit in R for implementation of Oster (2019) in Stata or R, respectively.\nConstruct the change in Medicare payments achievable for an integrated versus non-integrated physician practice due to the 2010 update to the physician fee schedule, \\(\\Delta P_{it}\\). Use this as an instrument for \\(INT_{it}\\) in a 2SLS estimator following the same specification as in Equation @ref(eq:ols). Present your results along with those of your “first stage” and “reduced form”.\n\nHere is a little code snippet to help you work with the fee schedule update and the utilization and payment data in constructing the instrument. In this code chunk, the medicare.puf object is the provider and utilization data for a specific year, the pfs.yearly object is the physician fee schedule update data for the same year (except for years after 2013, in which case pfs.yearly should just be the 2013 data because the price shock is fully implemented as of 2013), and the taxid.base object is the MD-PPAS data from 2009 limited to just the NPI and the group1 variable (the group1 and group2 variables are encrypted versions of the physician’s tax ID, and I use the 2009 data so that I get a baseline measure of the practice before the price shock takes effect). The purpose of this code is to first merge the price shock information into service-level quantity data, then construct the total increase in revenue from the price shock based on observed quantities (that’s the numer variable), and divide by the total hypothetical revenue if payments never changed. The resulting phy_rev_change is intended to measure the increase in revenue for a given physician relative to revenue without the price shock. Finally, I average this across all physicians in a practice based on their observed practice affiliation as of 2009 and multiply by the practice size (I really just sum the ratio, but that’s the same thing). The resulting practice_rev_change variable is what you should use as your instrument for \\(INT_{it}\\).\n\n  price.shock &lt;- medicare.puf %&gt;% inner_join(taxid.base, by=\"npi\") %&gt;%\n    inner_join(pfs.yearly %&gt;% \n                 select(hcpcs, dprice_rel_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2007), \n               by=c(\"hcpcs_code\"=\"hcpcs\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate_at(vars(dprice_rel_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2010, price_nonfac_orig_2007), replace_na, 0) %&gt;%\n    mutate(price_shock = case_when(\n            i&lt;=2013 ~ ((i-2009)/4)*dprice_rel_2010,\n            i&gt;2013  ~ dprice_rel_2010),\n          denom = line_srvc_cnt*price_nonfac_orig_2010,\n          numer = price_shock*line_srvc_cnt*price_nonfac_orig_2010) %&gt;%\n    group_by(npi) %&gt;%\n    summarize(phy_numer=sum(numer, na.rm=TRUE), phy_denom=sum(denom, na.rm=TRUE), tax_id=first(tax_id)) %&gt;%\n    ungroup() %&gt;%\n    mutate(phy_rev_change=phy_numer/phy_denom) %&gt;%    \n    group_by(tax_id) %&gt;%\n    summarize(practice_rev_change=sum(phy_rev_change, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n\nYes, the idea of summing a ratio is a bit odd. But it’s easier to think of the instrument as the product of baseline (pre-shock) practice size and the average relative revenue change due to the price shock. In that context, the sum of the ratio is really just an interaction term that incorporates information on the price shock magnitude and baseline practice size. Each of these things alone are poor instruments, but together for the practice it reflects a “better” instrument.\n\nAssess the “need” for IV by implementing a Durbin-Wu-Hausman test with an augmented regression. Do this by first estimating the regression, \\(INT_{it} = \\lambda \\Delta P_{it} + \\beta x_{it} + \\gamma_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\varepsilon_{it}\\), take the residual \\(\\hat{\\nu} = INT_{it} - \\hat{INT}_{it}\\), and run the regression \\[y_{it} = \\delta INT_{it} + \\beta x_{it} + \\gamma_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\kappa \\hat{\\nu} + \\varepsilon_{it}.\\] Discuss your results for \\(\\hat{\\kappa}\\).\nNow let’s pay attention to potential issues of weak instruments. As we discussed in class, one issue with weak instruments is that our typical critical values (say, 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval) from the equation of interest (sometimes called the structural equation) are too low in the presence of a weak first-stage. These issues are presented very clearly and more formally in the Andrews, Stock, and Sun (2019) survey article. For this question, you will consider two forms of inference in the presence of weak instruments. Hint: Check out the ivmodel package in R or the ivreg2 command in Stata for help getting the AR Wald statistic.\n\nPresent the results of a test of the null, \\(H_{0}: \\delta=0\\), using the Anderson-Rubin Wald statistic. Do your conclusions from this test differ from a traditional t-test following 2SLS estimation of Equation @ref(eq:ols)?\nGoing back to your 2SLS results…inflate your 2SLS standard errors to form the \\(tF\\) adjusted standard error, following Table 3 in Lee et al. (2021). Repeat the test of the null, \\(H_{0}: \\delta=0\\), using standard critical values and the \\(tF\\) adjusted standard error.\n\nFollowing the Borusyak and Hull (2021) working paper (BH), we can consider our instrument as a function of some exogenous policy shocks and some possibly endogenous physician characteristics, \\(\\Delta P_{it}=f\\left(g_{pt}; z_{ipt}\\right)\\), where \\(g_{pt}\\) captures overall payment shocks for procedure \\(p\\) at time \\(t\\), and \\(z_{ip}\\) denotes a physician’s quantity of different procedures at baseline. We can implement the BH re-centering approach as follows:\n\nConsider hypothetical price changes over a set of possible counterfactuals by assuming that the counterfactuals consist of different allocations of the observed relative price changes. For example, take the vector of all relative price changes, reallocate this vector randomly, and assign new hypothetical relative price changes. Do this 100 times. This isn’t “all” possible counterfactuals by any means, but it will be fine for our purposes.\nConstruct the expected revenue change over all possible realizations from previously, \\(\\mu_{it} = E [\\Delta P_{it}]= \\sum_{s=1}^{100} \\sum_{p} g_{pt}^{s} z_{ip}\\).\nRe-estimate Equation @ref(eq:ols) by 2SLS when instrumenting for \\(INT_{it}\\) with \\(\\tilde{\\Delta} P_{it} = \\Delta P_{it} - \\mu_{it}\\). Intuitively, this re-centering should isolate variation in the instrument that is only due to the policy and remove variation in our instrument that is due to physician practice styles (the latter of which is not a great instrument).\n\nDiscuss your findings and compare estimates from different estimators.\nReflect on this assignment.

What did you find most surprising?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAltonji, Joseph G, Todd E Elder, and Christopher R Taber. 2005. “An Evaluation of Instrumental Variable Strategies for Estimating the Effects of Catholic Schooling.” Journal of Human Resources 40 (4): 791–821.\n\n\nLee, David S., Justin McCrary, Marcelo J.

Practice writing good code and showing me only what I would need to recreate your results.\nThe exercise is worth 30 points toward your final grade, with 20 points allocated to the accuracy of your work (2 points for each of 10 questions) and 10 points allocated to the replicability of your work (i.e., can I easily recreate your answers from your repository?)\nIn your project, please be sure to organize your folders in a useful way. The way I organize things (though certainly not the only way to do it) is to keep a folder for each new project and named accordingly. I typically have the following subfolders:\n\nData: This is where I keep the raw data files and any additional data files I create as part of my analysis. I also keep a “Research Data” folder on my computer that has raw data that I access regularly, in which case the “Data” folder in any given project includes symbolic links to the original raw data. I usually split this folder into two: “input” for raw data; and “output” for final or intermediate datasets.\nData Code: This is where I keep the code for data management (merging, clean-up, wrangling, etc.). Final analytic datasets created by this code go to the “Data/output” subdirectory.\nAnalysis: This is where I keep my analysis code files and log files (if relevant).\nResults: Output from the analysis code files. I tend to separate this into two subfolders - one for tables and one for figures.\nPapers: If I’m writing the paper in R Markdown or Quarto, this is where I keep all of the markdown files. With most co-authored work, though, we write in Overleaf. In that case, I’ll still download different versions of the paper into this folder when necessary (e.g., for different journal submissions)\nPresentation: This is where I keep my slides and underlying code files.\n\nIt’s good to start developing some organization practices that work best for you. It’s extremely easy to forget what you were doing on a project once you have several things going at once, especially when you wait for 6-8 months after submitting a paper for publication.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn this exercise, we’re going to focus on causal inference in panel data, specifically on difference-in-differences and event studies. These are the workhorses of modern applied empirical microeconomics (although not as much of a panacea as once perceived). We’ll employ these research designs in the context of hospital “uncompensated care.” The simple question we want to consider is, “Does insurance expansion reduce hospital uncompensated care?”\n\n\nResources and data\nThe data for this assignment comes from three sources. These data will be made available on our class OneDrive folder. Note that you may want to use (or create) a crosswalk file between state names and abbreviations, as different datasets often have different ways to capture “state”. Stata has a user-written program, statastates, that should do what you need. R has a similar object, stcrosswalk, as part of the crosswalkr package.\n\nHospital Cost Report Information System: Hospitals submit cost reports to CMS with a wealth of (very messy) data on the hospital, including information on the extent of uncompensated care provided by the hospital in that fiscal year. You can get started with these data using my GitHub repository, HCRIS.\nProvider of Services files: These raw data (through 2019) are available from NBER POS. Data for more recent years is available directly from the CMS POS Data. The data provide information on characteristics of healthcare providers, including information on hospital ownership type. We’ll use these files to collect some basic hospital-level covariates. You can access my GitHub repository for these data here, as well as a similar repo using Stata from Adam Sacarny, available here.\nMedicaid Expansion: Data on which states expanded Medicaid under the ACA, and when they expanded, is available from the Kaiser Family Foundation website. For more info, see my GitHub repository, Insurance Access. The relevant dataset is also available on our class OneDrive folder, “KFF_medicaid_expansion_2019.txt”.\n\n\n\nQuestions\nFocus on the years from 2003 through 2019, which are years for which data on uncompensated care are available. In your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions.\n\nProvide and discuss a table of simple summary statistics showing the mean, standard deviation, min, and max of hospital total revenues and uncompensated care over time.\nCreate a figure showing the mean hospital uncompensated care from 2003 to 2019. Show this trend separately by hospital ownership type (private not for profit and private for profit).\nUsing a simple DD identification strategy, estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on hospital uncompensated care using a traditional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimation: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\delta D_{it} + \\varepsilon_{it},\n(\\#eq:dd)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(D_{it}=1(E_{i}\\leq t)\\) in Equation @ref(eq:dd) is an indicator set to 1 when a hospital is in a state that expanded as of year \\(t\\) or earlier, \\(\\gamma_{t}\\) denotes time fixed effects, \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) denotes hospital fixed effects, and \\(y_{it}\\) denotes the hospital’s amount of uncompensated care in year \\(t\\). Present four estimates from this estimation in a table: one based on the full sample (regardless of treatment timing); one when limiting to the 2014 treatment group (with never treated as the control group); one when limiting to the 2015 treatment group (with never treated as the control group); and one when limiting to the 2016 treatment group (with never treated as the control group). Briefly explain any differences.\nEstimate an “event study” version of the specification in part 3: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} +\\sum_{\\tau &lt; -1} D_{it}^{\\tau} \\delta_{\\tau} + \\sum_{\\tau&gt;=0} D_{it}^{\\tau} \\delta_{\\tau} + \\varepsilon_{it},\n(\\#eq:event)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(D_{it}^{\\tau} = 1(t-E_{i}=\\tau)\\) in Equation @ref(eq:event) is essentially an interaction between the treatment dummy and a relative time dummy. In this notation and context, \\(\\tau\\) denotes years relative to Medicaid expansion, so that \\(\\tau=-1\\) denotes the year before a state expanded Medicaid, \\(\\tau=0\\) denotes the year of expansion, etc. Estimate with two different samples: one based on the full sample and one based only on those that expanded in 2014 (with never treated as the control group).\nSun and Abraham (SA) show that the \\(\\delta_{\\tau}\\) coefficients in Equation @ref(eq:event) can be written as a non-convex average of all other group-time specific average treatment effects. They propose an interaction weighted specification: \\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{it} = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} +\\sum_{e} \\sum_{\\tau \\neq -1} \\left(D_{it}^{\\tau} \\times 1(E_{i}=e)\\right) \\delta_{e, \\tau} + \\varepsilon_{it}.\n(\\#eq:iwevent)\n\\end{equation}\\] Re-estimate your event study using the SA specification in Equation @ref(eq:iwevent). Show your results for \\(\\hat{\\delta}_{e, \\tau}\\) in a Table, focusing on states with \\(E_{i}=2014\\), \\(E_{i}=2015\\), and \\(E_{i}=2016\\).\nPresent an event study graph based on the results in part 5. Hint: you can do this automatically in R with the fixest package (using the sunab syntax for interactions), or with eventstudyinteract in Stata. These packages help to avoid mistakes compared to doing the tables/figures manually and also help to get the standard errors correct.\nCallaway and Sant’Anna (CS) offer a non-parametric solution that effectively calculates a set of group-time specific differences, \\(ATT(g,t)= E[y_{it}(g) - y_{it}(\\infty) | G_{i}=g]\\), where \\(g\\) reflects treatment timing and \\(t\\) denotes time. They show that under the standard DD assumptions of parallel trends and no anticipation, \\(ATT(g,t) = E[y_{it} - y_{i, g-1} | G_{i}=g] - E[y_{it} - y_{i,g-1} | G_{i} = \\infty]\\), so that \\(\\hat{ATT}(g,t)\\) is directly estimable from sample analogs. CS also propose aggregations of \\(\\hat{ATT}(g,t)\\) to form an overall ATT or a time-specific ATT (e.g., ATTs for \\(\\tau\\) periods before/after treatment). With this framework in mind, provide an alternative event study using the CS estimator. Hint: check out the did package in R or the csdid package in Stata.\nRambachan and Roth (RR) show that traditional tests of parallel pre-trends may be underpowered, and they provide an alternative estimator that essentially bounds the treatment effects by the size of an assumed violation in parallel trends. One such bound RR propose is to limit the post-treatment violation of parallel trends to be no worse than some multiple of the pre-treatment violation of parallel trends. Assuming linear trends, such a relative violation is reflected by \\[\\Delta(\\bar{M}) = \\left\\{ \\delta : \\forall t \\geq 0, \\lvert (\\delta_{t+1} - \\delta_{t}) - (\\delta_{t} - \\delta_{t-1}) \\rvert \\leq \\bar{M} \\times \\max_{s&lt;0} \\lvert (\\delta_{s+1} - \\delta_{s}) - (\\delta_{s} - \\delta_{s-1}) \\rvert \\right\\}.\\] The authors also propose a similar approach with what they call “smoothness restrictions,” in which violations in trends changes no more than \\(M\\) between periods. The only difference is that one restriction is imposed relative to observed trends, and one restriction is imposed using specific values. Using the HonestDiD package in R or Stata, present a sensitivity plot of your CS ATT estimates using smoothness restrictions, with assumed violations of size \\(M \\in \\left\\{ 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 \\right\\}\\). Check out the GitHub repo here for some help in combining the HonestDiD package with CS estimates. Note that you’ll need to edit the function in that repo in order to use pre-specified smoothness restrictions. You can do that by simply adding Mvec=Mvec in the createSensitivityResults function for type=smoothness.\nDiscuss your findings and compare estimates from different estimators (e.g., are your results sensitive to different specifications or estimators? Are your results sensitive to violation of parallel trends assumptions?).\nReflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging? What did you find most surprising?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn this assignment, we’re going to work through some applied issues related to regression discontinuity designs. We’ll cover the basics of strict and fuzzy RD, and we’ll work through standard specification tests. We’ll also introduce some more technical aspects of bin and bandwidth selection.\n\n\nResources and data\nThe data for this assignment comes from the AEJ: Policy website, where Keith Ericson’s complete dataset is available. The data are available here. I’ve also uploaded the data to our class OneDrive folder under the directory “Ericson 2014.”\n\n\nQuestions\nIn your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions.\n\nRecreate the table of descriptive statistics (Table 1) from Ericson (2014).\nRecreate Figure 3 from Ericson (2014).\nCalonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) discuss the appropriate partition size for binned scatterplots such as that in Figure 3 of Ericson (2014). More formally, denote by \\(\\mathcal{P}_{-,n} = \\{ P_{-,j} : j=1, 2, ... J_{-, n} \\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}_{+,n} = \\{ P_{+,j} : j=1, 2, ... J_{+, n} \\}\\) the partitions of the support of the running variable \\(x_{i}\\) on the left and right (respectively) of the cutoff, \\(\\bar{x}\\). \\(P_{-, j}\\) and \\(P_{+, n}\\) denote the actual supports for each \\(j\\) partition of size \\(J_{-,n}\\) and \\(J_{+,n}\\), such that \\([x_{l}, \\bar{x}) = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{J_{-,n}} P_{-, j}\\) and \\((\\bar{x}, x_{u}] = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{J_{+,n}} P_{+, j}\\). Individual bins are denoted by \\(p_{-,j}\\) and \\(p_{+,j}\\). With this notation in hand, we can write the partitions \\(J_{-,n}\\) and \\(J_{+,n}\\) with equally-spaced bins as \\[p_{-,j}=x_{l} + j \\times \\frac{\\bar{x} - x_{l}}{J_{-,n}},\\] and \\[p_{+,j} = \\bar{x} + j \\times \\frac{x_{u} - \\bar{x}}{J_{+,n}}.\\] Recreate Figure 3 from Ericson (2014) using \\(J_{-,n}=J_{+,n}=10\\) and \\(J_{-,n}=J_{+,n}=30\\). Discuss your results and compare them to your figure in Part 2.\nWith the notation above, Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) derive the optimal number of partitions for an evenly-spaced (ES) RD plot. They show that \\[J_{ES,-,n} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{V_{-}}{\\mathcal{V}_{ES,-}} \\frac{n}{\\text{log}(n)^{2}} \\right\\rceil\\] and \\[J_{ES,+,n} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{V_{+}}{\\mathcal{V}_{ES,+}} \\frac{n}{\\text{log}(n)^{2}} \\right\\rceil,\\] where \\(V_{-}\\) and \\(V_{+}\\) denote the sample variance of the subsamples to the left and right of the cutoff and \\(\\mathcal{V}_{ES,.}\\) is an integrated variance term derived in the paper. Use the rdrobust package in R (or Stata or Python) to find the optimal number of bins with an evenly-spaced binning strategy. Report this bin count and recreate your binned scatterplots from parts 2 and 3 based on the optimal bin number.\nOne key underlying assumption for RD design is that agents cannot precisely manipulate the running variable. While “precisely” is not very scientific, we can at least test for whether there appears to be a discrete jump in the running variable around the threshold. Evidence of such a jump may suggest that manipulation is present. Provide the results from the manipulation tests described in Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma (2018). This test can be implemented with the rddensity package in R, Stata, or Python.\nRecreate Panels A and B of Table 3 in Ericson (2014) using the same bandwidth of $4.00 but without any covariates.\nCalonico, Cattaneo, and Farrell (2020) show that pre-existing optimal bandwidth calculations (such as those used in Ericson (2014)) are invalid for appropriate inference. They propose an alternative method to derive minimal coverage error (CE)-optimal bandwidths. Re-estimate your RD results using the CE-optimal bandwidth (rdrobust will do this for you) and compare the bandwidth and RD estimates to that in Table 3 of Ericson (2014).\nNow let’s extend the analysis in Section V of Ericson (2014) using IV. Use the presence of Part D low-income subsidy as an IV for market share to examine the effect of market share in 2006 on future premium changes.\nDiscuss your findings and compare results from different binwidths and bandwidths. Compare your results in part 8 to the invest-then-harvest estimates from Table 4 in Ericson (2014).\nReflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging?

Each proposal is worth 10 points toward your final grade, 8 points for the written proposal and 2 points for the presentation. The written proposal should be 2 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins, and the presentation should be 10-15 minutes and no more than 5 slides.\nYou’ll present four proposals thoughout the semester. Please pick dates for each proposal and sign up on the Proposals tab of the Google Sheet here by January 26. Note that you have to pick one date for each proposal, so you can really only choose between three days for each proposal. All written proposals and presentations are due via Canvas by the first due date in each block (2/2, 2/23, 3/22, and 4/12). So if you select 2/9 as your presentation date for the first proposal, you still have to submit your written proposal and presentation slides by 2/2. This is just to ensure a common due date for everyone.\nThink of the research proposal as a more informed version of brainstorming. This should be something for which you’ve given some serious thought but where you haven’t yet started any analysis. You at least have some idea of the data you’d like to use, where to find it, and how to use it (i.e., you have some identification strategy and estimation method in mind). The purpose of the proposal is to get feedback from me and your peers on your research idea.\nThere will be a lot of constructive criticism in these proposals and presentations. This is a good thing! It’s how we learn. But it can be a bit uncomfortable at first. The key is to disassociate yourself from your research. It’s not personal. It’s just research. And it’s not even research yet. It’s just an idea. So don’t take it personally. And don’t be afraid to give constructive criticism to others, provided it’s delivered in a respectful manner. The more we can create a constructive, supportive, and participative environment, the easier and more productive these propposals will be for everyone."

Today we’ll spend some time talking about the structure of the class, the assignments, grading, etc. We’ll also navigate the website for a bit just to make sure we can get around and understand where different information is. But before we do that, I want to spend some time motivating the area of health economics and why I think this is a critical area of study for economists.\nWe’ll discuss more details in class, but the basic idea is:\n\nHealthcare is an extremely complicated market, particularly in the U.S., and the sources of complexity reflect a unique combination of common economic issues. Some of they key issues (highlighted 60 years ago in Arrow (1963)!) include uncertainty in need for medical care, the “experience” nature of the good that makes it difficult to ascertain quality and price in advance, information asymmetry (between patients and physicians, and between patients and insurers), the distortionary effects of insurance, licensing and regulation, as well as professional norms and non-standard objective functions.\nDue to its complexity, healthcare is extremely expensive (this is true almost everywhere, but again, especially in the U.S.) and constitutes a large share of GDP\nBecause of its expense and complexity, healthcare plays a major role in public finance, labor markets, and inequality\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nArrow, Kenneth J. 1963. “Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care.” The American Economics Review 53 (5). https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/53.5.941-973.pdf."

    "text": "The goal for today’s class is to understand the demand for healthcare and health insurance, as well as the complexities of health insurance choice. Focus areas and selected papers for this class are listed below.\n\nDemand for Healthcare and Health Insurance: The RAND and Oregon Experiments\nThe RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) was conducted between 1974 and 1982 and was one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of its time, randomly assigning families to different health insurance plans with varying levels of cost-sharing to assess the impact on healthcare utilization and outcomes. In a more recent experiment, a limited number of Medicaid slots were allocated through a lottery to low-income adults in Oregon. This lottery system essentially created a randomized controlled experiment, allowing the researchers to compare outcomes between those who received Medicaid coverage and those who did not. We’ll discuss the RAND HI via Aron-Dine, Einav, and Finkelstein (2013), and we’ll discuss the Oregon Medicaid experiment with Finkelstein et al. (2012).\n\n\nComplexities of Health Insurance Choice\nThere are many papers examining the presence and effects of poor decision making in health insurance choice. As examples of these papers, we’ll discuss Abaluck and Gruber (2011), Jonathan D. Ketcham et al. (2012), Jonathan D. Ketcham, Kuminoff, and Powers (2016) and Abaluck and Gruber (2016). The authors show that many people make suboptimal choices when selecting health insurance plans, and the papers essentially debate the source of this “poor” decision making and the scope of improvment from government intervention. These papers collectively speak to the importance of understanding how people make decisions in health insurance markets, and the implications for designing policies that can improve outcomes and best match people to health insurance plans.\n\n\nImproving Health Insurance Choice\nBuilding off the literature documenting poor health insurance choices, the natural policy question is whether we can improve health insurance choices at relatively low cost. This is a difficult question to answer, as it requires a clear understanding of why people make poor choices. We’ll discuss Brot-Goldberg et al. (2023) as an example of research in this area.\nThis paper leverages two natural experiments to study the impact of default options in public drug insurance for low-income elderly in the U.S. The study finds that default plan selections significantly influence plan enrollment and drug utilization, with 96% of beneficiaries following an exogenously changed default. The paper proposes a general framework for choice under costly cognition, suggesting that both paternalistic defaults (steering consumers to suitable plans) and ‘shocking’ defaults (triggering active choices) could be optimal, depending on a key parameter: the elasticity of active choice propensity relative to the default value. However, they find this elasticity to be close to zero, indicating minimal active choice difference between beneficiaries assigned to well-matched vs. poorly-matched defaults. The study also shows that poorly-matched defaults lead to significant declines in drug consumption, suggesting that the welfare losses from following these defaults likely outweigh any potential gains from induced active choices. A third natural experiment reveals that the limited active choice observed seems largely random, driven by transient attentional shifts within beneficiaries. The results highlight the importance of paternalistic defaults in insurance market design, likely benefiting beneficiaries more than harming them.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAbaluck, Jason, and Jonathan Gruber. 2011. “Choice Inconsistencies Among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part D Program.” American Economic Review 101 (4): 1180–210. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.4.1180.\n\n\n———. 2016. “Choice Inconsistencies Among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part D Program: Reply.” American Economic Review 106 (12): 3962–87. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20151318.\n\n\nAron-Dine, Aviva, Liran Einav, and Amy Finkelstein. 2013. “The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, Three Decades Later.” Journal of Economic Perspectives 27 (1): 197–222.\n\n\nBrot-Goldberg, Zarek, Timothy Layton, Boris Vabson, and Adelina Yanyue Wang. 2023. “The Behavioral Foundations of Default Effects: Theory and Evidence from Medicare Part D.” American Economic Review 113 (10): 2718–58. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20210013.\n\n\nFinkelstein, Amy, Sarah Taubman, Bill Wright, Mira Bernstein, Jonathan Gruber, Joseph P Newhouse, Heidi Allen, Katherine Baicker, et al. 2012. “The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment: Evidence from the First Year.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 127 (3): 1057–1106.\n\n\nKetcham, Jonathan D., Nicolai V.

    "text": "The goal for today’s class is to consider where the research on health insurance might be headed and discuss some papers in those directions. For these classes, I’m trying to select topics with significant policy interest and room for additional research. There are many areas of active research in the study of health insurance, so this is far from exhaustive. Focus areas and selected papers for this class are listed below.\n\nHealth Insurance Design and Consumer Behavior\nThe design of health insurance plans (like copayments, deductibles, and coverage decisions) directly affects consumer choices and healthcare utilization. This area is crucial for policy design, ensuring that insurance structures meet both economic efficiency and equity goals. We’ll discuss Brown and Jeon (2023) and Ho and Lee (2020) as an example of this line of current/future research.\n\n\nInnovation/Technology Adoption and Health Insurance\nIn affecting how services are paid for, insurance can also affect the adoption of new technologies and innovations in healthcare. We’ll discuss Garthwaite (2012) and Agha, Kim, and Li (2022) as examples of this line of work.\n\n\nHealth Insurance Networks\nThe structure of health insurance networks can affect the quality of care that patients receive. We’ll briefly discuss Gruber and McKnight (2016) as an example of this line of work, even though it is a little bit older for “current/future” research, and we’ll discuss Kreider et al. (2022) as a more recent example in this space.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAgha, Leila, Soomi Kim, and Danielle Li. 2022. “Insurance Design and Pharmaceutical Innovation.” American Economic Review: Insights 4 (2): 191–208. https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20210063.\n\n\nBrown, Zach Y, and Jihye Jeon. 2023. “Endogenous Information and Simplifying Insurance Choice,” August. https://public-websites-umich-edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/~zachb/brown_jeon_endo_info.pdf.\n\n\nGarthwaite, Craig L. 2012. “The Doctor Might See You Now: The Supply Side Effects of Public Health Insurance Expansions.” American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 4 (3): 190–215. https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.4.3.190.\n\n\nGruber, Jonathan, and Robin McKnight. 2016. “Controlling Health Care Costs Through Limited Network Insurance Plans: Evidence from Massachusetts State Employees.” American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 8 (2): 219–50. https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.20140335.\n\n\nHo, Kate, and Robin S.

    "text": "The goal for today is to examine the role of competition in health insurance, including “managed competition”. Focus areas and selected papers are listed below.\n\nCompetition and Health Insurance Premiums\nAs in just about any market, increased competition will tend to reduce prices. But examining this question empirically is challenging in health insurance, and there are reasons that this typical relationship may reverse in health insurance. We’ll discuss Dafny, Duggan, and Ramanarayanan (2012) and Ho and Lee (2017) as an exellent examples of research in this area.\n\n\nManaged Competition\nThe U.S. health insurance model increasingly relies on private insurance even for government-sponsored programs like Medicare and Medicaid. This model is based on the idea of “managed competition”, which relies on market forces to improve the efficiency of health insurance markets. We’ll discuss Cabral, Geruso, and Mahoney (2018) and Curto et al. (2021) as examples of papers in this area. Cabral, Geruso, and Mahoney (2018) cautions against the assumption that increased subsidies will directly benefit consumers, emphasizing the need for careful design and regulation of subsidy mechanisms, and Curto et al. (2021) examines the potential for competition to improve consumer outcomes in these markets. Both papers underscore the importance of balancing market forces with effective regulation to achieve the goals of managed competition in government-sponsored health insurance programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCabral, Marika, Michael Geruso, and Neale Mahoney. 2018. “Do Larger Health Insurance Subsidies Benefit Patients or Producers?

    "text": "What does health insurance do?\nThe most basic function of health insurance is to protect against the financial risk of health shocks. But health insurance also provides access to health care services, which can improve health outcomes. Health insurance might also encourage overuse by shielding patients from the financial implications of their health and health care decisions (i.e., ex ante and ex post moral hazard). And naturally, the extent to which health insurance succeeds in these areas for a given patient will depend on how well that patient’s needs match the plan (i.e., the choice of their health insurance plan, which is a difficult choice to make). Some of the key papers in this literature are listed below. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a list of papers that I have found useful in my own research. I’ve excluded papers focusing on the long-term effects of health insurance (e.g., on education, future labor market outcomes, or intergenerational health). If you’re intersted in that space, you might start with Miller and Wherry (2018) and East et al. (2023). There’s also a large literature on the effects of health insurance on labor force participation and mobility, which we won’t cover here. For a review of that literature, you might start with Gruber and Madrian (2002).\n\n    List of Key Papers (click to expand)"

Adverse selection occurs when individuals with different health risks have different preferences for health insurance. For example, individuals with high health risks may be more likely to purchase health insurance than individuals with low health risks. This can lead to a market failure in which health insurance is not offered at a price that is affordable to low-risk individuals. The consequences of adverse selection have been known for a very long time - for an initial treatment of this topic, see Ackerloff (1970) and Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976).\n\n    List of Key Papers (click to expand)"

The first group of papers we’ll discuss today attempt to decompose variation in healthcare spending between demand and supply-side factors. We’ll focus on Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams (2016) and Badinski et al. (2023) specifically. While these are relatively recent papers, the build on a much older literature studying variation in spending.\n\n\nPhysician Agency and Financial Incentives\nWhile there are many papers studying this topic, we’ll discuss Iizuka (2012) and Clemens and Gottlieb (2014) in class. Iizuka (2012) considers prescribing behaviors in a unique setting where physicians can profit directly from different prescriptiond rugs.

As always, this is just my prediction on topic areas for the future. It’s far from exhaustive and might be way off! Focus areas and selected papers for this class are listed below.\n\nAgency and Referrals\nWe are increasingly learning that the group (or network) of physicians involved in patient care matters for their outcomes, perhaps more than any single physician in isolation. We’ll discuss Zeltzer (2020) and Agha et al. (2022) as examples of papers in this area. Agha et al.

As an example of this work, we’ll discuss Gaynor, Propper, and Seiler (2016). The authors examing the role of physicians in hospital choice, focusing on plausibly exogenous changes to the set of hospitals from which a physician could select. The paper is also a good example of recent work on consideration sets in discrete choice analysis.\n\n\nAgency in Other Healthcare Settings\nAs healthcare delivery changes, so do the opportunities for healthcare providers to exercise agency. We’ll discuss Eliason et al. (2020) and Gruber, Hoe, and Stoye (2023) as examples of this work. Eliason et al. (2020) consider the role of agency in the context of long-term acute care. This is a setting where patients are often transferred to a different facility for care, and the authors examine how providers might discharge patients to long-term acute care facilities based on their financial incentives.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In explaining why we spend so much money on healthcare in the U.S., Uwe Reinhardt famously said, “It’s the prices, stupid.” The spirit of his comment is that, while people will try to cite lots of reasons for high healthcare spending (such as physician salaries, profit incentives, poorer health of U.S. population relative to other countries, overuse of healthcare, fraud, etc.), these things really aren’t big factors relative to price differences. Essentially, if we want to really address healthcare spending, we need to place downward pressure on prices. With that in mind, Module 3 covers pricing and competition in healthcare.\nThe observation that prices in healthcare care are high is not new. It’s been a problem for decades. Some good surveys of this problem and suggestions to improve competitiveness in healthcare include: Dranove and Satterthwaite (2000), M. Gaynor and Vogt (2000), Martin Gaynor and Vogt (2003), M. Gaynor and Town (2012a), M. Gaynor and Town (2012b), M. Gaynor, Ho, and Town (2015), M. Gaynor, Mostashari, and Ginsburg (2017), Handel and Ho (2021). Our slides for today reflect a lot of the general insights from these types of surveys.\nOne important background point in the study of competition is the role of market definition and the different measures of market power. Everson, Hollingsworth, and Adler-Milstein (2019) and Dranove and Ody (2016) provide good reviews of these points, respectively.

On the insurance side, prices (as in premiums, deductibles, etc.) are typically readily available, so the literature on that area tends to focus on quality disclosure. On the provider side, there is a literature focusing on both quality and price transparency, which we’ll discuss separately. Focus areas and selected papers for this class are listed below.\n\nInformation and Insurance Choice\nWe’ll start our discussion with Chernew, Gowrisankaran, and Scanlon (2008), who presents a nice model of patient learning in the context of quality disclosure. We’ll also discuss Dafny and Dranove (2008), which is one of the seminal papers in this area. The authors compare plan choices before and after the release of plan quality information, and they essentially ask whether the disclosure of such information is really “new” or if the market had already learned about plan quality through other means.\n\n\nQuality Information and Provider Choice\nSince healthcare is an experience good, we simply don’t know the quality of our care until after we’ve received it. But we might still be able to better predict quality based on providers’ past outcomes. Such information has historically been difficult or impossible to observe, but this is changing. We’ll discuss two studies on the effects of quality disclosure on provider choice: Dranove et al. (2003) and Brown et al. (2023).\n\n\nPrice Information and Provider Choice\nIn the U.S., prices for healthcare services are notoriously difficult to observe, but there have been recent efforts to change this. We’ll discuss two studies on the effects of price disclosure on provider choice: (christensen2023?) and Brown (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, Zach Y. 2019. “Equilibrium Effects of Health Care Price Information.” The Review of Economics and Statistics 101 (4): 699–712. https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00765.\n\n\nBrown, Zach Y., Christopher Hansman, Jordan Keener, and Andre F.

We’ll discuss Dickstein, Jeon, and Morales (2024) as a good example of this work. The authors find that when physicians have better information about patients’ costs, they are more likely to recommend cost-effective treatments, leading to a reduction in overall healthcare spending. This highlights the importance of improving information flow to physicians (instead of patients) as a potential strategy for enhancing healthcare efficiency and reducing patient costs.\n\n\nDisclosure in Bargaining\nAnother interesting aspect of disclosure is that it can change the bargaining position of different entities. Grennan and Swanson (2020) study this in the context of hospital negotiations over prices for medical devices. They find that increased transparency leads to more competitive prices, benefiting hospitals through lower costs for supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDickstein, Michael J., Jihye Jeon, and Eduardo Morales. 2024. “Patient Costs and Physicians’ Information.” Working {Paper}.

This paper discusses on the evolution of learning models in consumer and physician behavior over the past two decades. It reviews the literature on learning models, particularly emphasizing model in Erdem and Keane (1996). The authors discuss how learning models have significantly enhanced understanding of consumer behavior, especially in the context of brand loyalty and the long-term effects of advertising.

    "text": "In a dynamic setting, physicians are forward-looking in that they consider the value of “experimentation”. In other words, physicians might try something new in hopes of learning more about the quality of the new treatment, understanding that this knowledge will affect all patients moving forward. We’ll discuss the following topics and papers in this class, all of which allow for experimentation in learning.\n\nLearning with Experimentation\nWe’ll discuss Crawford and Shum (2005) in this topic. That paper introduces a dynamic matching model where patients learn from prescription experiences about drug effectiveness. A notable aspect of this model is its differentiation of drugs’ symptomatic and curative effects and the endogenization of treatment duration based on drug choices and patients’ recovery probabilities. The study reveals that while drug efficacy varies significantly across patients, learning effectively reduces the costs of uncertainty in pharmaceutical markets​.\n\n\nLearning with Physician Skill\nPhysicians may be limited in the extent of learning based on their underlying skill level, as studied in (currie2020?). This paper introduces a model that highlights the trade-off between exploiting known treatments with the highest expected value and experimenting with newer treatments that may offer higher potential benefits. The model suggests that a doctor’s diagnostic skill influences this trade-off, with higher skill leading to a greater variety of drug choices and better matching of drugs to individual patients. The study utilizes patient claims data and finds that, generally, a broader drug portfolio used by skilled doctors predicts better patient outcomes, except in cases where the doctor’s decisions contravene established professional guidelines.\n\n\nLearning with External Factors\nLearning might also be impeded or enhanced by other factors, such as insurers. Dickstein (2018) considers this in his paper, where he estimates a dynamic model to examine how physicians, under varying insurance plan structures, learn and update their treatment strategies based on patient feedback. This model uniquely accounts for the role of insurance in influencing both patient access to drugs and the feedback loop essential for physicians’ learning. The paper highlights the interplay between insurance plan design and the efficient provision of experience goods in healthcare, demonstrating how insurance parameters can shape the learning and decision-making process.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCrawford, Gregory S, and Matthew Shum. 2005. “Uncertainty and Learning in Pharmaceutical Demand.” Econometrica 73 (4): 1137–73.\n\n\nDickstein, Michael. 2018. “Efficient Provision of Experience Goods: Evidence from Antidepressant Choice.” Working {Paper} 18-17.

Most of the papers in this literature are essentially careful accounting exercises, decomposing spending into various categories. Such papers often aren’t econometrically rigorous and don’t have a clear causal identification strategy. However, they are still important because they help us understand the sources of waste in the U.S. healthcare system. Focus areas and papers are listed below.\n\nInefficiency in U.S. Healthcare\nWe’ll start class with general papers in the area of waste in U.S. healthcare, Garber and Skinner (2008) and Cutler, Wikler, and Basch (2012). Garber and Skinner (2008) discusses different aspects of waste such as administrative costs, prices, and the use of healthcare services. It contrasts these factors with other countries to determine whether the inefficiency in the U.S. system is unique. Cutler, Wikler, and Basch (2012) is a “perspectives” paper focusing specifically on administrative waste. This paper discusses high administrative costs as a significant component of healthcare spending and considers strategies to reduce these costs while maintaining or improving healthcare quality.\n\n\nOveruse and Low-value Care\nDoyle, Graves, and Gruber (2017) is a great example of a more formal analysis of overuse and low-value care in healthcare. The paper examines inefficiencies in the U.S. healthcare system by exploiting ambulance referral practices, highlighting how ambulances often transport patients to emergency departments for non-emergent conditions, leading to unnecessary and costly care. This study contributes to understanding healthcare waste by revealing the misalignment between medical needs and the use of high-cost emergency services.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCutler, David, Elizabeth Wikler, and Peter Basch. 2012. “Reducing Administrative Costs and Improving the Health Care System.” New England Journal of Medicine 367 (20): 1875–78. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1209711.\n\n\nDoyle, Joseph J., John A.

We’ll talk about some of these things in today’s class, focusing on the following areas and papers.\n\nDetection\n(shekar2023?) considers how to identify overbilling in the U.S. healthcare system. The authors employ large-scale Medicare claims data to detect patterns indicative of fraud or overbilling, notably in an unsupervised manner that does not rely on pre-labeled training data. This approach provides a significant advancement in fraud detection, offering both high accuracy and explainability, which is crucial for understanding and acting upon the findings.\n\n\nPrivate Enforcement\nOne way to avoid fraud is to rely on individuals to report fraud after it has occurred, and other way is to impose sufficient safegaurds so that fraud is either extremely hard to commit or detected immediately via regulatory audit. Leder-Luis (2023) offers an anaylsis of the first approach, considering the role of whistleblower-initiated lawsuits in uncovering fraudulent activities and their impact on reducing financial misappropriations in public healthcare spending. Such whistleblower-initiated lawsuits are a key component of the U.S. False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to sue on behalf of the government and receive a portion of the recovered funds.\n\n\nRegulatory Enforcement\nAs examples of papers that consider more official regulatatory enforcement (e.g., a more proactive effort to avoid or identify fraud while it’s happening), we will discuss Shi (2023) and Eliason et al. (2021). Shi (2023) examines the role and efficacy of Medicare audits in identifying and reducing wasteful spending in the healthcare system. The paper analyzes how these audits target and impact various areas of expenditure, assessing their effectiveness in curbing unnecessary costs. Eliason et al. (2021) examines how specific regulations and litigation practices influence fraudulent activities in this sector. It offers a critical analysis of the effectiveness of current measures in preventing fraud and suggests potential improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEliason, Paul J., Riley J.

More specifically, I want to test whether decision assistance (e.g., availability of spouse/partner, nearby children or other family, close friends) reduces medical errors or otherwise changes the way individuals access health care, and I want to estimate the health effects of any such changes.

    "text": "What is the hook?\nIn many settings, individuals rely on expert agents to make decisions on their behalf. This is particularly true in healthcare, where patients often rely on physicians to make decisions about their care. However, alignment between a physician’s treatment decisions and patient preferences may be limited by the physician’s knowledge, biases, or financial incentives. For example, physicians may be more likely to recommend treatments that are more profitable for them or their organization, more likely to recommend treatments for which they are more familiar, or more likely to discount certain symptoms or side-effects based on their biases. All such factors tend to drive a wedge between a patient’s preferences for care and the actual treatment decisions recommended by the physician. This proposal focuses on the role of decision assistance in reducing this wedge (i.e., reducing the role of non-clinical factors such as physician bias, financial incentives, or decision heuristics)."

    "section": "Economic model",
    "text": "Economic model\nAs a starting point, consider the model of physician agency in Cutler et al. (2019). In their model, patient \\(i\\) maximizes their utility over healthcare, \\(V=V(p, Y, h, \\eta)\\), where \\(p\\) denotes healthcare prices, \\(Y\\) denotes income, \\(h\\) denotes health, and \\(\\eta\\) generally captures preferences for care. A simplified example is to consider patient’s utility given by \\(V(x) = B_{D}(x) - px\\), where \\(B_{D}(x)\\) captures the patient’s perceived benefits of care, \\(x\\), and \\(p\\) denotes the patient’s out-of-pocket price. The patient’s optimum amount of care from maximizing this utility is denoted, \\(x^{D}\\).\nPhysician \\(j\\)’s utility when treating patient \\(i\\) is then given by\n\\[\nu_{ij} = \\alpha B_{S}(x_{i}; \\theta_{i}) + \\beta \\pi(x_{i}; \\theta_{i}),\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(B_{S}(x_{i}; \\theta_{i})\\) captures the physician’s perceived benefits of care, \\(\\alpha\\) denotes the weight that a physician places on perceived benefits (i.e., physician’s altruism), \\(\\pi(x_{i}; \\theta_{i})\\) denotes the physician’s profit from providing care, and \\(\\beta\\) denotes the weight assigned to profit in the physician’s utility.\nIn Equation 1, \\(\\theta_{i}\\) captures the “accuracy” of a physician’s assessment of the patient’s needs. Denoting the true health benefits of care by \\(B(x)\\), and normalizing \\(\\theta_{i}\\) such that \\(\\theta_{i} \\in [0,1]\\), then \\(B_{S}(x_{i}; \\theta_{i}) \\rightarrow_{\\theta_{i} \\rightarrow 1} B(x_{i})\\). But as reflected in \\(\\pi(x_{i}; \\theta_{i})\\), increasing \\(\\theta_{i}\\) is costly to the physician. For example, this may require the physician to spend more time with the patient, or to consult with other physicians.\nFor the purposes of this proposal, the key is that \\(\\theta_{i}\\) is patient specific, so that it may be easier for a physician to assess the needs of some patients than others. Patients with more support from family or friends may be easier to assess, as such support can relay important information to the physician or advocate more strongly for certain tests, and thus \\(\\theta_{i}\\) may be higher for these patients. In maximizing Equation 1, the physician will select some amount of care, \\(x^{*}(\\theta_{i})\\), which may increase or decrease in \\(\\theta_{i}\\) depending on other elements of the model.\n\nOther frameworks\nThe model above is a starting point, but there are other frameworks that could be used to model the role of decision assistance. For example,\n\nDecision assistance as a productivity shifter: Cutler et al. (2019) consider a similar mechanism in the form of physician productivity shifters, where they denote perceived health benefits by \\(g(x)=\\alpha_{j} + s(x)\\). In their setup, \\(s(x)\\) is the true health benefit of care \\(x\\), and \\(\\alpha_{j}\\) denotes physician productivity, which the authors suggest could vary across patients due to professional uncertainty.\nDecision assistance and learning: Another possible modeling framework could come from the physician learning literature wherein physicians select treatment based on the perceived match value between the patient and the treatment (as in Crawford and Shum (2005)). This match value is a function of the physician’s knowledge of the patient, and the physician’s knowledge of the treatment. In this framework, decision assistance could be modeled as increasing the physician’s knowledge of the patient, and thus increasing the match value between the patient and the treatment and facilitating faster learning."

    "text": "Empirical strategy\nIdentifying the effect of decision assistance on healthcare utilization requires some exogenous shift in availability of decision assistance. Possible sources of such variation include the sudden loss or gain of a spouse or partner, loss or gain of nearby children or other family. I propose the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), linked to Medicare claims data, to identify such variation and its effects on health outcomes and utilization. The HRS is a longitudinal survey of individuals over the age of 50, and includes detailed information on health, healthcare utilization, and decision assistance.\nSimilar to the patient movers literature initiated by Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams (2016), I propose to use the HRS to identify individuals who experience a sudden change in decision assistance due to the unexpected death of a spouse or partner, the move of close family (e.g., children moving away from or closer to parents), or an individual’s own move toward or away from family. I will then use Medicare claims data to identify changes in healthcare utilization and health outcomes following these changes in decision assistance."
