# Health Improvements

*Major* improvements in life expectancy (and many other measures of health) across the world

- Poverty reduction
- Technology development and innovation
- Technology diffusion and adoption
- Access to better services, including health care

## But the U.S. is unique

## What does that mean?

- Are we just woefully inefficient?
- Yes, but the complete answer is more complicated
  - U.S. very good in some areas (breast cancer treatment, interventional cardiology)
  - Let's look at some more graphs from the [Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019)



# Why Study Economics of Health Care?


---


1. Health and health care are constantly changing

2. Health expenditures in 2020: \$4.1 trillion, 19.7% of GDP, \$12,530 per person (from [NHE Fact Sheet](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet))

3. U.S. health care is uniquely inefficient in many ways

Lots of interesting economic issues in health care, not all unique to the US.

:::{.fragment}
1. Extremely heterogeneous products
2. Asymmetric information between patients and physicians
3. Unobservable quality (experience good)
4. Unpredictable need (inability to shop in many cases)
5. Distortion of incentives due to insurance
6. Adverse selection (asymmetric information between patients and insurers)
:::

- These factors exist in other markets and in other countries, but...
- Health care is unique in the combination of these issues
- U.S. is unique in the extent of these issues in health care (policy problems)
