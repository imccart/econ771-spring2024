## Overview

- Health insurance is a complex product, and selecting a plan is a difficult task for enrollees
- Do people make 'good' health insurance choices?


::: {.fragment}
We'll discuss this through the lens of four papers:

- @ketcham2012

## Research Question

- Significant cost differentials across many plan choices in Medicare Part D
- 'Quality' of choice has potentially large welfare implications for enrollees

::: {.fragment}
**Research question:** What factors to Part D enrollees consider when choosing a plan?
:::

---

## Model

- CARA utility: $$U(C) = -exp( -\gamma (W-C)),$$ with $C \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
- Indirect utility: $$u(\mu, \sigma^{2}) = E[U(C)] = -\alpha exp (\gamma \mu + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma^2),$$ where $\alpha = -exp (\gamma W)$
- First-order taylor approximation around $(\mu', \sigma^{2'})$ yields: $$u(\mu, \sigma^{2}) \approx u(\mu', \sigma^{2'}) -\alpha \gamma (\mu - \mu') - \frac{1}{2} \alpha \gamma^2 u(\mu', \sigma^{2'})(\sigma^2 - \sigma^{2'})$$

::: {.aside}
Note: $\mu'$ and $\sigma^{2'}$ are fixed in this setup (conceptually the mean and variance of the 'average' or 'reference' plan)
:::

---

## Model

- Total costs, $C$, composed of a fixed premium, $\pi$, and variable out of pocket cost, $OOP$
- Implies $\sigma^{2} = var(C) = var( \pi + OOP) = var(OOP)$ and $\mu = E[C] = E[\pi + OOP] = \pi + \mu^{*}$
- Dropping constant terms and adding an error term: $$u = -\alpha \gamma u(\mu', \sigma^{2'})(\pi + \mu^{*}) - \frac{1}{2} \alpha \gamma^2 u(\mu', \sigma^{2'}) \sigma^2 + \varepsilon$$

---

## Estimating equation

$$\begin{align*}
u &=& -\alpha \gamma u(\mu', \sigma^{2'})(\pi + \mu^{*}) & - \frac{1}{2} \alpha \gamma^2 u(\mu', \sigma^{2'}) \sigma^2 & + \varepsilon \\
  &=& \beta_{0} \pi_{j} + \beta_{1} \mu_{ij}^{*}                          & + \beta_{2} \sigma^{2} & + \lambda x_{j} + \delta q_{b(j)} + \varepsilon_{ij}
\end{align*}$$

- CARA risk aversion coefficient, $\gamma = 2 \times \frac{\beta_{2}}{\beta_{1}}$
- $x$ captures other financial plan characteristics (e.g., deductible)
- $q$ captures plan ratings and other non-financial attributes (constant across plans within an insurer, or 'brand' in the paper)

---

## Data and estimation

- Data from 2006 Medicare Part D enrollment and drug utilization (private data)
- Plan characteristics (public)
- Multinomial logit discrete choice model, estimated via MLE
- Estimate $\mu$ from observed drug expenditures
- Estimate $\sigma^{2}$ from observed drug expenditures among 'similar' individuals

## Main results

## Key findings

$$\beta_{0} \pi_{j} + \beta_{1} \mu_{ij}^{*} + \beta_{2} \sigma^{2} + \lambda x_{j} + \delta q_{b(j)} + \varepsilon_{ij}$$

1. $\beta_{0}=\beta_{1}$. Should trade-off one dollar in premium and one dollar in out of pocket costs, but results suggest $\beta_{0} > \beta_{1}$
2. $\lambda=0$. Shouldn't care about other financial aspects conditional on OOP costs and premiums, but $\lambda \neq 0$ in general
3. $\beta_{2} < 0$. Should prefer plans with lower variance in OOP costs, but $\beta_{2}$ often very small

::: {.fragment}
**Main takeaway:** Enrollees far overweight premiums

- 27% increase in consumer welfare if enrollees picked the cost-minimizing plan (partial equilibrium)

## Motivation

While enrollees may make bad Part D decisions, they may learn over time

## Model, data, and estimation

$$\Delta o_{i} = \alpha + \gamma \Delta h_{i} + \Delta \varepsilon_{i}$$

- $\Delta$ denotes changes from 2006 to 2007
- $o_{i}$ is overspending, measured as difference between observed costs and those under the lowest cost plan
- $h_{i}$ is health status
- Data from CMS and CVS Caremark
- Estimate via OLS

---

## Main results

![](/files/figures/ketcham2012-tab1.png){}


---

## Key findings

- Large reductions in overspending from 2006 to 2007, unexplained by changes in health
- Reductions appear to be driven by switching plans
- Switchers were more likely to experience more overspending in 2006
- Good evidence that individuals are learning in this market and evolving their plan choices accordingly


# The Debate 

---

## Ketcham et al. (2016), "Choice Inconsistencies among the Elderly...: Comment"

![](/files/figures/ketcham2016-quote.png){}

---

## Key point of contention

- Are choices consistent with maximization of **some** utility function?
- Or, are choices consistent with maximization of **a specific** utility function?

::: {.fragment}
@ketcham2016 argue that the former is sufficient and that deviations from the latter are not necessarily evidence of poor decision making
:::


---

## Specific concerns raised

- Imperfect assignment of individuals to plans in @abaluck2011
- Failure to consider quality in notions of 'good' choice (e.g., formulary restrictions, prior authorization, customer service, mail order options, etc.)

---

## Abaluck and Gruber (2016), "Choice Inconsistencies among the Elderly...: Reply"

![](/files/figures/abaluck2016-quote.png){}

---

## Main response

- Searching for plans dominated in all dimensions, with increasing number of quality measures, is unreasonable and has little power
- @ketcham2016 allow flexible brand preferences, which implies that dominated choices can only be made among plans from the same brand
- Speaks to the definition of the 'efficient frontier' of choices

---

## Summary of the debate

- Extent of choice inconsistencies differs based on normative assumptions
- Can we find other dimensions of plans that may rationalize observed choices? Not fully, but yes
- Should we engage in such an exercise?

::: {.fragment}
Significant survey evidence that Medicare enrollees are confused:

- 73% of seniors (91% of pharmacists and 90% of doctors) say prescription drug plans are too complicated
- 60% of seniors say "Medicare should select a handful of plans that meet certain standards so seniors have an easier time choosing"
