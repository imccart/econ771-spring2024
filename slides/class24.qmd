## Table of contents

1. Information problems everwhere
2. Quality disclosure 
3. Price disclosure


# Information Problems

---

## Information problems are everywhere

- Healthcare
- Education (state funding decisions, college ratings, etc.)
- Finance (credit ratings, bond ratings, etc.)
- Food (nutrition labels, etc.)
- Any product really!

---

## Specifically in healthcare...

- Hospital quality (pay for performance, hospital choice/star ratings)
- Health insurance (Medicare Advantage star ratings)
- HHA, SNF, Hospice (star ratings)
- Physician quality (physician compare, report cards)
- Google reviews, yelp, etc. for all of the above


# Quality Disclosure

---

## Background, @dranove2010

- Quality often unknown or uncertain ex ante
- Consumers rely on other information to infer quality
- Quality disclosure provides consumers with direct information on product or service quality (unlike implied quality via price, brand, etc.)
- @dranove2010 discuss:
  - Full (and voluntary) disclosure
  - Barriers to full disclosure
  - Third-party disclosure
  - Empirical evidence

---

## Full (and Voluntary) Disclosure

Under what conditions might *all* firms voluntarily disclose quality information (e.g., unraveling)?

  - Products identical except for single vertical dimension
  - Sellers have complete and private quality informatioin
  - Disclosure is costless
  - Monopoly or competitive market
  - Homogeneous consumers with rational expectations about undisclosed quality
  - All quality disclosure is public information

::: {.fragment}
Violations of any condition will tend to prohibit full disclosure

## Barriers to Full and Voluntary Disclosure

- **Disclosure Costs:** Even minimal costs can prevent sellers from disclosing
- **Market Structure:** Duopoly and oligopoly markets may see strategic non-disclosure as a competitive tool
- **Consumer Response:** Lack of consumer attention or understanding can diminish the incentives for disclosure
- **Heterogeneous Preferences:** When consumer preferences vary widely, the impact of disclosure on market choices becomes unpredictable
- **Unobservable Quality Attributes:** In some markets, quality cannot be easily measured or observed

---

## Third-party Disclosure

If voluntary disclosure won't work, third-party entities may verify and disseminate information about product quality. Key issues for third-party disclosure include:

- **Key issues:**
  - Potential conflicts of interest if funded by sellers
  - Ensuring unbiased and accurate reporting
  - Overcoming information asymmetry without introducing new biases

- **Potential effects:**
  - Can significantly affect consumer trust and behavior
  - Potential to improve market efficiency by enhancing transparency

---

## Empirical Evidence

- Healthcare: Disclosure of hospital quality metrics influences consumer choices and promotes competition among providers
- Education: School performance reports affect parental choices for their childrenâ€™s education, leading to shifts in school enrollments
- Finance: Transparency in financial reporting and bond ratings significantly affects investor behavior and market dynamics

::: {.fragment}
Consumer response varies significantly based on the type of information disclosed, how it is presented, and consumer awareness
:::

---

## Practical Barriers

- **Quality Measurement Challenges:**
  - Difficulty in accurately measuring and reporting quality across different industries
  - Impact of these challenges on the reliability and effectiveness of disclosure
- **Strategic disclosure:** Evidence of both improvements in quality and strategic behavior to game disclosure systems (e.g., cream skimming, MA contract loading)
- **Certifier Behavior:** Potential biases and conflicts of interest that may affect the impartiality of third-party certifiers

::: {.fragment}
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Empirical evidence supports the notion that quality disclosure can influence market behavior
  - But...effectiveness depends on accuracy of information, engagement, integrity of certifiers, and "newness" of the information

# Price Disclosure

---

## Example from @luco2019

- Mandatory online price disclosure for retail gasoline in Chile
- Predictions:
  - If consumers use the information, competition will increase and prices will fall
  - If consumers do not access the site, disclosure may facilitate tacit collusion
  - Potential heterogeneity in use across markets, with distributional implications

---

## Model

- @luco2019 presents a theoretical model of price competition and consumer search
- Shows that disclosure may facilitate coordination and increase prices
  - Depends on the rate in which firms observe deviations from the collusive price and the share of informed consumers

---

## Estimation

- Standard TWFE estimation: $$y_{it} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} 1(\text{Website Available})_{it} + \gamma x_{it} + \xi_{i} + \eta_{t} + \epsilon_{it}$$
- There was a rollout of the website, so this is staggered (pre-dates the recent DD stuff on staggered DD)
- Interact disclosure with income and search requests

---

## Findings

- Competition decreases (prices increase) on average
- Higher prices increases for low income and low search areas
- Price decreases in areas with high income and high search 

---

## Price Disclosure in Healthcare

- Some small scale studies of price disclosure for specific health insurers or other contexts
- Only large efforts are more recent through CMS price transparency initiatives
- Data poorly formatted and difficult to use, compliance is low
- Turquoise Health claims to have collected and organized these data (haven't used it myself)
