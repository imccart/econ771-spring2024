## Wasteful?

- Estimates are that more than 30% of health care expenditures are "wasteful": [(The Atlantic, 2013)](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/youre-getting-too-much-healthcare/281896/)
- Some clear areas of waste:
  - Payment differentials by location of treatment (policy quirks)
  - Better imaging with little benefit
  - Proton treatment (for some conditions)
  - Heart stents
  - Arthroscopic knee surgery

Many estimates of "waste" are after-the-fact. It's actually very hard to identify waste before-hand. [Report on End-of-life Spending](http://news.mit.edu/2018/value-late-life-health-care-spending-medicare-0628)

# Physician Agency


---

## Definition

- Physicians are better informed about treatment decisions than patients, and so there exists some **agency** relationship between the two. For many conditions, patients can't treat themselves even if they wanted to.
- Physicians also face incentives other than patient welfare, such as income, reputation, organizational pressures, and career advancement

---

## Basic setup from @mcguire2000

- Denote quantity of physician services by $x$
- Denote benefit of services to patient by $B(x)$
- Patients pay (and physicians receive) a price of $p$ for each unit of service $x$
- Physicians incur cost $c$ for each unit of care
- Net benefit to patients is $NB(x)=B(x)-px$
- Physicians must choose quantity of care at least better than the patient's outside option, $NB(x)= B(x)-px \geq NB^{0}$.


---

## Solving the model

With this framework, how much care will be provided? What is the optimal value of $x$?


---

## Solving the model

- Patient's objective: $$\max_{x} NB(x) = \max_{x} B(x) - px$$
- Physician's objective: $$\max_{x} \pi(x) = \max_{x} p x - c x \text{ s.t. } NB(x) \geq NB^{0}$$
- Lagrangian: $$\mathcal{L} = p x - c x + \lambda (B(x) - p x - NB^{0})$$
- First order conditions:

$$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial p} & = x - \lambda x = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} & = p - c + \lambda B'(x) - \lambda p = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} &= B(x) - p x - NB^{0} = 0
\end{align}$$


---

$$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial p} & = x - \lambda x = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} & = p - c + \lambda B'(x) - \lambda p = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} & = B(x) - p x - NB^{0} = 0
\end{align}$$

- From the first equation, we have $\lambda = 1$ (seller gains all surplus...any relaxation of surplus goes to profit)
- From the second equation, we have $B'(x)=c$ (seller will produce until marginal cost equals marginal benefit)
- Compare to patient's optimal, $B'(x)=p$

## Agency with capitated payments

- Physician receives fixed ("capitated") amount for each patient, $R$, along with some price per unit of service, $p_{s}$
- Physician therefore paid $R + (p_{s} - c)x$ for each patient
- Number of patients for each physician expressed as a positive function of the net benefit offered, $n(NB)$, where $NB=B(x) - p_{d}x$. Here, we assume that the insurer sets $p_{d}$ and $p_{s}$ separately (the demand and supply price, respectively).
- Physician again aims to maximize profits, $\pi=n(NB)\left[R+(p_{s}-c)x\right]$.


---

## Solution with capitated payments

Maximizing the profit function yields:
$$n'(NB)(B'(x) - p_{d}) \left[R + (p_{s} - c)x \right] + n(NB)(p_{s}-c) = 0$$

Rearranging terms and multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{NB}$, we get:
$$\frac{B'(x) - p_{d}}{NB} \frac{R + (p_{s} - c)x}{p_{s}-c} = - \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n,NB}}$$

1. What happens for $R=0$?
2. What about $R>0$, assuming $p_{s}<c$?

## Problems with basic model

- Setup from @mcguire2000 is useful as it introduces wedge between physician and patient optimums due solely to different costs faced by the two parties
- But it's not very flexible and it makes some strong assumptions about competition (outside options) and price setting/taking


---

## @cutler2019

Physicians aim to maximize: $$u_{ij} = \alpha B_{S}(x_{i}) + \beta \pi(x_{i}) - \delta_{d} (x_{i} - x_{i}^{D}) - \delta_{O}(x_{i} - x_{i}^{O}),$$

- $B_{S}(x_{i})$ is the perceived benefit to the patient, with utility weight $\alpha$
- $\pi(x_{i})$ is the physician's profit and $\beta$ the weight on profit in utility
- $x_{i}$ is the quantity of care provided
- $x^{D}$ and $x^{O}$ are preferred quantities from an informed patient and from other organizational pressures, respectively
- $\delta_{d}$ and $\delta_{O}$ are functions of the deviations from these preferred quantities

::: {.fragment}
First order condition for $x_{i}$ yields: $$\alpha B{'}_{S}(x_{i}) = - \beta \pi{'}(x_{i}) + \delta_{d}{'} + \delta_{O}{'}$$
:::

---

$$\alpha B{'}_{S}(x_{i}) = - \beta \pi{'}(x_{i}) + \delta_{d}{'} + \delta_{O}{'}$$

- Physician sets $x_{i}$ to balance the marginal benefit to the patient with financial incentives, disutility from deviating from the patient's preferred quantities, and disutility from organizational pressures
- 'Supplier-induced demand'
  - $x>x^{D}$: Not really an issue as it could still be that $B(x)>B(x^{D})$
  - More narrowly, $x>x^{D}$ and $B(x)<B(x^{D})$

---

## Taking this to data

- Impose functional form assumptions so that: $$u_{ij} = \alpha B(x_{i}) + \beta \pi x_{i} - \frac{\gamma_{D}}{2} (x_{i} - x_{i}^{D})^{2} - \frac{\gamma_{O}}{2} (x_{i} - x_{i}^{O})^{2}$$
- Theoretical optimum: $$\alpha B{'}(x_{i}) = \beta \pi  - \gamma_{D}(x_{i} - x_{i}^{D}) - \gamma_{O}(x_{i} - x_{i}^{O})$$
- First-order taylor expansion of $B{'}(x_{i})$ around $\bar{x}$ yields: $$x_{i} = \bar{x} + Z_{i}^{D} + Z_{i}^{S} + \varepsilon_{i},$$ so that observed treatment levels are a function of some mean value/starting point and demand and supply-side shifts
