## Overview

- One of the central health economics questions: what does health insurance do?
- Early literature focused on effects of health insurance on healthcare utilization (ex post moral hazard)
- Another way to phrase the question: **How much should people have to pay for healthcare?**
- To answer this, we need to know the effects of different forms of insurance on healthcare utilization


# The RAND Health Insurance Experiment

(see @aron-dine2013 for a review)

---

## Setup

- Partnership with RAND corporation and team of health economists in 1970s
- Key question: If people pay more for healthcare, will they use less?
- Randomized 2,000 households into groups:
  - free-care plan
  - high-deductible (up to \$5,500 in 2023 dollars) with full-insurance afterward (really an out-of-pocket maximum)
  - different co-insurance rates in between (95, 50, 25, mixed)

---

## Setup

- Experiment ran from 1974-1981, cost of \$410 million (in 2023 dollars)
- RAND was insurer, collected all data on healthcare used
- Physical exam at the end of the experiment
- All data available now for researchers

---

## Analysis

$$y_{it} = \lambda_{p} + \tau_{t} + \alpha_{lm} + \varepsilon_{it}$$

- $i$ denotes individual and $t$ denotes year
- $\lambda_{p}$: plan fixed effects (main coefficients of interest)
- $\tau_{t}$: year fixed effects
- $\alpha_{lm}$: location, start-month fixed effects (randomization was by start month)

---

## Results: How Much Healthcare?

- Free care plan families used \$2,000 (in 2021 dollars) in care
- High-deductible plan families used \$1,600 in care
- 20% increase in healthcare utilization for free care plan
- Commonly cited -0.2 price elasticity of demand for healthcare

---

## Results: What Type of Healthcare?

- Provided medical documentation to panel of physicians
- Assiged care as highly effective versus rarely effective
- High-deductible plan families:
  - 30% less highly effective care
  - 30% less rarely effective care
- Conclusion: higher prices lead to less care across the board

---

## Results: Health Outcomes

- No significant differences in health outcomes on average
- Patients with chronic conditions were worse off in high-deductible plan

---

## Threats to validity

1. Valid randomization (not really an issue)
2. Adverse selection in participation (could be a problem)
3. Reporting of claims (some minor concern)

## Results with adjustments

## Elasticity estimates

Commonly cited -0.2 price elasticity of demand for healthcare comes from:

- Step 1: intensive vs extensive
  - Group care into defined "episodes"
  - Find no relationship between price and utilization *within* episode
  - Focus on extensive margin (presence of an episode)

---

## Elasticity estimates

Commonly cited -0.2 price elasticity of demand for healthcare comes from:

- Step 2: spot vs future price
  - Compare episode rates among those close to hitting OOP max versus those already over
  - No difference in episode rates
  - Conclude that spot price matters


---

## Elasticity estimates

Commonly cited -0.2 price elasticity of demand for healthcare comes from:

- Step 3: calculating elasticity
  - Limit sample to part of year where people are far from OOP max (around \$500)
  - Calculate arc elasticities for each care setting and for different plan types
  - Many estimates 'around' -0.2

---

## Problems with elasticity applications

How should we predict the response to price changes in a nonlinear pricing environment when we only have a single price elasticity estimate?

---

## Problems with elasticity applications

![@aron-dine2013](/files/figures/aron-dine-fig1.png){width=150%}

---

- Budget neutral in that each contract has same costs to insurer for same distribution of healthcare utilization
- Different assumptions on how to reduce plans to a single average price yield very different predictions (factor of 2)

---

## Key takeaways

- Confident that price matters in healthcare (i.e., people respond to higher prices by reducing healthcare)
- Less confident in the magnitude of the response
- Difficult to apply single elasticity estimates to nonlinear pricing contracts


# The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment

(see @finkelstein2012 for a review)

---

## Setup

- Oregon expanded Medicaid in 2008
- 90,000 people applied for 10,000 slots
- Randomized lottery for slots
- Nearly 36,000 selected for lottery, 30\% enrolled

---

## Analysis

- Compare outcomes of those with insurance to those without
- Use lottery selection as an instrument for insurance coverage

---

## Analysis

$$\begin{align}
y_{ihj} &= \pi_{0} + \pi_{1}Ins_{ih} + \pi_{2}x_{ih} + \pi_{c}V_{ih} + \nu_{ihj} \\
Ins_{ih} &= \delta_{0} + \delta_{1}Lottery_{h} + \delta_{2}x_{ih} + \delta_{3}V_{ih} + \mu_{ihj}
\end{align}$$

- individual $i$ in household $h$ for outcome $j$
- $x_{ih}$ are covariates that are correlated with lottery sign up
- $V_{ih}$ are other covariates thought to be correlated with outcomes (for increases in precision)

---

## Main results

- 2.1 percentage point (30%) increase in the probability hospital admission
- 8.8 percentage point (15%) increase in the probability of taking any prescription drugs
- 21 percentage point (35%) increase in the probability of having an outpatient visit
- No change (but wide confidence intervals) in ED visits 
- 0.3 standard deviation increase in reported compliance with recommended preventive care (e.g., mammograms and cholesterol monitoring)
- 6.4 percentage point (25%) decline in the probability of having an unpaid medical bill sent to a collections agency
- 20 percentage point (35%) decline in having any out-of-pocket medical expenditures
- improvements in self-reported physical and mental health, overall well-being, access to, and quality of are
