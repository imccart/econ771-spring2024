e^{L}(\\zeta_{i})$\n\n- $CS = \\int \\left[ (e^{H}(\\zeta) - p)1(\\pi(\\zeta) \\geq p) + e^{L}(\\zeta) 1(\\pi(\\zeta) < p) \\right] d G(\\zeta)$\n- $PS = \\int \\left[ (p - c(\\eta)) 1(\\pi(\\zeta) \\geq p) \\right] d G(\\zeta)$\n- $TS = CS + PS = \\int \\left[ (e^{H}(\\zeta) - c(\\eta)) 1(\\pi(\\zeta) \\geq p) + e^{L}(\\zeta) 1(\\pi(\\zeta) < p) \\right] d G(\\zeta)$\n- Socially efficient to purchase health insurance only if $\\pi(\\eta_{i}) \\geq c(\\eta_{i})$\n\n---\n\n## Textbook Adverse Selection\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](class8-1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- $D>MC$ because willingness to pay is expected costs plus risk premium\n- Relationship between demand and AC reflects problems due to adverse selection\n\n---\n\n## Main points\n\n- Key assumptions:\n  - Simplifying assumption that insurers earn 0 profit (at least approximately)\n  - Individuals select plans based on health needs (which is private information)\n  - Common price to all enrollees of a given plan (community rating)\n- Possible outcomes:\n  - Full insurance (Demand always above AC)\n  - Partial unravelling (Demand intersects with AC somewhere)\n  - Full unravelling (Demand always below AC)\n\n::: {.fragment}\n- **Limitations**\n  - Only applies to existing contracts\n  - Cannot speak to entry or exit decisions\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Incorporating data\n\n- Goal is to estimate demand curve, $D(p)$, and average costs, $AC(p)$\n- $MC(P)$ derives from product of $D(p)$ and $AC(p)$\n- Need data on:\n  - prices and quantities\n  - expected costs, such as claims or medical spending\n  - exogenous shifters in prices\n\n---\n\n## Possible sources of variation\n\n- State regulations introduce variation across people and over time\n- Tax policies such as health insurance subisides\n- Field experiments and \"idiosyncrasies of firm pricing behavior\"\n- Shifts in administrative costs of handling claims\n- Common demand instruments such as plausibly exogenous changes in market conditions\n\n---\n\n## Empirical application\n\n- Health insurance for Alcoa employees in 2004\n- \"High\" versus \"low\" coverage PPO plans\n- Exogenous variation:\n  - 7 different pricing menus for same coverage\n  - Focus on relative difference, $p= p_{H} - p_{L}$\n  - Price menus determined by president of business unit\n  - 40 units in company\n\n::: {.fragment}\n\"As a result of this business structure, employees doing the same job in the same location may face different prices for their health insurance benefits due to their business unit affiliation.\"\n:::\n\n---\n\n- Denote medical expenditures by $m_{i}$\n- Denote incremental costs by $c_{i}=c(m_{i}; H) - c(m_{i}; L)$\n- $c(m_{i}; H)$ is observed\n- $c(m_{i}; L)$ computed based on terms of contract $L$\n\n\n---\n\n- Baseline equations:\n$$\\begin{align*} \nD_{i} & = \\alpha + \\beta p_{i} + \\epsilon_{i} \\\\\nc_{i} & = \\gamma + \\delta p_{i} + u_{i}\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n- From those: $$MC = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{ \\partial D_{i} c_{i}}{\\partial p} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} (\\alpha \\delta + \\gamma \\beta + 2\\beta \\delta p)$$\n- Find intersection points and compare to equilibrium points ($AC(p) = D(p)$) and efficient points ($MC(p) = D(p)$)\n\n\n# Pricing and Welfare in Health Plan Choice\n\n(see @bundorf2012 for details)\n\n---\n\n## Motivation\n\n- Prices often not reflective of costs of coverage\n- Insurers have incentive to attract specific types of enrollees\n- Enrollees have incentive to select specific types of plans\n\n::: {.fragment}\n**Research question:** What are the welfare effects of these forms of selection?\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n![](/files/figures/bundorf-fig2.png){}\n\n- \"Standard\" setup with 2 plans\n- Assumes WTP $\\Delta u $ perfectly correlated with health risk $\\theta$ \n- Assumes WTP increasing in $\\theta$ faster than costs (i.e., slope of demand curve steeper than slope of AC curve)\n\n---\n\nRelaxing assumptions yields potential inefficient plan allocation\n\n![](/files/figures/bundorf-fig1.png){}\n\n---\n\n## Data\n\n- \"Private firm that helps small and mid-sized employers manage health benefits\"\n- 11 employers in one metropolitan area in \"western United States\" from 2004-2005\n- Data on 6,603 enrollees (3,683 employees), claims, plan selection, etc.\n\n---\n\n## Model: Demand\n\nHousehold utility: $$u_{hj} = \\alpha_{1} x_{j} + \\alpha_{2} x_{h} + \\psi (r_{h} + \\mu_{h} ; \\alpha_{3}) - p_{j} + \\sigma_{\\varepsilon} \\varepsilon_{hj}$$\n\n- $x_{j}$: plan characteristics\n- $x_{h}$: household characteristics\n- $r_{h}$: health risk score (based on observable demographics)\n- $\\mu_{h}$: unobserved health status\n\n\n---\n\n- Household $h$ selects plan $j$, $q_{hj} =1$, if $u_{hj} \\geq u_{hk} \\forall k \\in J_{h}$\n- Standard logit model for plan choice: $$Pr(q_{hj}=1 | x_{h}, \\mu_{j}) = \\frac{ \\exp(v_{hj}) }{ \\sum_{k} \\exp(v_{hk}) },$$\n\nfor $v_{hj} = u_{hj} - \\sigma_{\\varepsilon} \\varepsilon_{hj}$\n\n---\n\n## Model: Costs\n\nCosts assumed: $$c_{ij} = a_{j} + b_{j}(r_{i} + \\mu_{i} -1) + \\eta_{ij}$$\n\n- $a_{j}$: baseline cost for standard enrollee\n- $b_{j}$: marginal cost of insuring a higher/lower risk enrollee\n- Costs for firm-year $f$ and insurer $k$ are sum of all relevant $c_{ij}$\n\n---\n\n## Model: Other things\n\n- Plan bids: markup over expected costs\n- Employer contribution: employers pass on share of lowest-cost plan plus fraction of incremental cost for high-cost plans\n\n---\n\n## Identification and estimation\n\n- Need variation in prices separate from unobserved household tastes or private health risks $\\mu$\n- Instrument for actual plan contribution using predicted contribution\n- Estimate using method of simulated moments (simulation comes from draws of $\\mu$ from normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^{2}$:\n  - Consumer choice: $E[q_{hj} - Pr(q_{hj}=1 | x_{h}, \\mu_{j})|z_{h}, \\mu_{h}] = 0$, with instruments $z_{h}$\n  - Plan costs: $E[C_{kf} - \\hat{C}_{kf}|x_{kf}, \\mu_{kf}] = 0$\n  - Plan bids: $E[B_{if} - \\hat{B}_{if}|x_{f}] = 0$\n\n---\n\n## Results\n\n![](/files/figures/bundorf-fig3.png){}\n\n---\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- Welfare loss of 2-11% of total cost of coverage under current pricing and contributions\n- Uniform contribution policy (or community rating) offers modest improvements (1-3%)\n- Risk-adjusted premium policy can capture entirety of welfare gains\n\n\n## References",
