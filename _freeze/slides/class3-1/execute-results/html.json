Valid randomization (not really an issue)\n2. Adverse selection in participation (could be a problem)\n3. Reporting of claims (some minor concern)\n\n---\n\n## Results with adjustments\n\n![@aron-dine2013](/files/figures/aron-dine-tab1.png){}\n\n\n---\n\n## Elasticity estimates\n\nCommonly cited -0.2 price elasticity of demand for healthcare comes from:\n\n- Step 1: intensive vs extensive\n  - Group care into defined \"episodes\"\n  - Find no relationship between price and utilization *within* episode\n  - Focus on extensive margin (presence of an episode)\n\n---\n\n## Elasticity estimates\n\nCommonly cited -0.2 price elasticity of demand for healthcare comes from:\n\n- Step 2: spot vs future price\n  - Compare episode rates among those close to hitting OOP max versus those already over\n  - No difference in episode rates\n  - Conclude that spot price matters\n\n\n---\n\n## Elasticity estimates\n\nCommonly cited -0.2 price elasticity of demand for healthcare comes from:\n\n- Step 3: calculating elasticity\n  - Limit sample to part of year where people are far from OOP max (around \\$500)\n  - Calculate arc elasticities for each care setting and for different plan types\n  - Many estimates 'around' -0.2\n\n---\n\n## Problems with elasticity applications\n\nHow should we predict the response to price changes in a nonlinear pricing environment when we only have a single price elasticity estimate?\n\n---\n\n## Problems with elasticity applications\n\n![@aron-dine2013](/files/figures/aron-dine-fig1.png){width=150%}\n\n---\n\n- Budget neutral in that each contract has same costs to insurer for same distribution of healthcare utilization\n- Different assumptions on how to reduce plans to a single average price yield very different predictions (factor of 2)\n\n---\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n- Confident that price matters in healthcare (i.e., people respond to higher prices by reducing healthcare)\n- Less confident in the magnitude of the response\n- Difficult to apply single elasticity estimates to nonlinear pricing contracts\n\n\n# The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment\n\n(see @finkelstein2012 for a review)\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n- Oregon expanded Medicaid in 2008\n- 90,000 people applied for 10,000 slots\n- Randomized lottery for slots\n- Nearly 36,000 selected for lottery, 30\\% enrolled\n\n---\n\n## Analysis\n\n- Compare outcomes of those with insurance to those without\n- Use lottery selection as an instrument for insurance coverage\n\n---\n\n## Analysis\n\n$$\\begin{align}\ny_{ihj} &= \\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1}Ins_{ih} + \\pi_{2}x_{ih} + \\pi_{c}V_{ih} + \\nu_{ihj} \\\\\nIns_{ih} &= \\delta_{0} + \\delta_{1}Lottery_{h} + \\delta_{2}x_{ih} + \\delta_{3}V_{ih} + \\mu_{ihj}\n\\end{align}$$\n\n- individual $i$ in household $h$ for outcome $j$\n- $x_{ih}$ are covariates that are correlated with lottery sign up\n- $V_{ih}$ are other covariates thought to be correlated with outcomes (for increases in precision)\n\n---\n\n## Main results\n\n- 2.1 percentage point (30%) increase in the probability hospital admission\n- 8.8 percentage point (15%) increase in the probability of taking any prescription drugs\n- 21 percentage point (35%) increase in the probability of having an outpatient visit\n- No change (but wide confidence intervals) in ED visits \n- 0.3 standard deviation increase in reported compliance with recommended preventive care (e.g., mammograms and cholesterol monitoring)\n- 6.4 percentage point (25%) decline in the probability of having an unpaid medical bill sent to a collections agency\n- 20 percentage point (35%) decline in having any out-of-pocket medical expenditures\n- improvements in self-reported physical and mental health, overall well-being, access to, and quality of are\n\n## References",
