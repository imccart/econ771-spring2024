Information problems everwhere\n2. Quality disclosure \n3. Price disclosure\n\n\n# Information Problems\n\n---\n\n## Information problems are everywhere\n\n- Healthcare\n- Education (state funding decisions, college ratings, etc.)\n- Finance (credit ratings, bond ratings, etc.)\n- Food (nutrition labels, etc.)\n- Any product really!\n\n---\n\n## Specifically in healthcare...\n\n- Hospital quality (pay for performance, hospital choice/star ratings)\n- Health insurance (Medicare Advantage star ratings)\n- HHA, SNF, Hospice (star ratings)\n- Physician quality (physician compare, report cards)\n- Google reviews, yelp, etc. for all of the above\n\n\n# Quality Disclosure\n\n---\n\n## Background, @dranove2010\n\n- Quality often unknown or uncertain ex ante\n- Consumers rely on other information to infer quality\n- Quality disclosure provides consumers with direct information on product or service quality (unlike implied quality via price, brand, etc.)\n- @dranove2010 discuss:\n  - Full (and voluntary) disclosure\n  - Barriers to full disclosure\n  - Third-party disclosure\n  - Empirical evidence\n\n---\n\n## Full (and Voluntary) Disclosure\n\nUnder what conditions might *all* firms voluntarily disclose quality information (e.g., unraveling)?\n\n  - Products identical except for single vertical dimension\n  - Sellers have complete and private quality informatioin\n  - Disclosure is costless\n  - Monopoly or competitive market\n  - Homogeneous consumers with rational expectations about undisclosed quality\n  - All quality disclosure is public information\n\n::: {.fragment}\nViolations of any condition will tend to prohibit full disclosure\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Barriers to Full and Voluntary Disclosure\n\n- **Disclosure Costs:** Even minimal costs can prevent sellers from disclosing\n- **Market Structure:** Duopoly and oligopoly markets may see strategic non-disclosure as a competitive tool\n- **Consumer Response:** Lack of consumer attention or understanding can diminish the incentives for disclosure\n- **Heterogeneous Preferences:** When consumer preferences vary widely, the impact of disclosure on market choices becomes unpredictable\n- **Unobservable Quality Attributes:** In some markets, quality cannot be easily measured or observed\n\n---\n\n## Third-party Disclosure\n\nIf voluntary disclosure won't work, third-party entities may verify and disseminate information about product quality. Key issues for third-party disclosure include:\n\n- **Key issues:**\n  - Potential conflicts of interest if funded by sellers\n  - Ensuring unbiased and accurate reporting\n  - Overcoming information asymmetry without introducing new biases\n\n- **Potential effects:**\n  - Can significantly affect consumer trust and behavior\n  - Potential to improve market efficiency by enhancing transparency\n\n---\n\n## Empirical Evidence\n\n- Healthcare: Disclosure of hospital quality metrics influences consumer choices and promotes competition among providers\n- Education: School performance reports affect parental choices for their childrenâ€™s education, leading to shifts in school enrollments\n- Finance: Transparency in financial reporting and bond ratings significantly affects investor behavior and market dynamics\n\n::: {.fragment}\nConsumer response varies significantly based on the type of information disclosed, how it is presented, and consumer awareness\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Practical Barriers\n\n- **Quality Measurement Challenges:**\n  - Difficulty in accurately measuring and reporting quality across different industries\n  - Impact of these challenges on the reliability and effectiveness of disclosure\n- **Strategic disclosure:** Evidence of both improvements in quality and strategic behavior to game disclosure systems (e.g., cream skimming, MA contract loading)\n- **Certifier Behavior:** Potential biases and conflicts of interest that may affect the impartiality of third-party certifiers\n\n::: {.fragment}\n- **Key Takeaways:**\n  - Empirical evidence supports the notion that quality disclosure can influence market behavior\n  - But...effectiveness depends on accuracy of information, engagement, integrity of certifiers, and \"newness\" of the information\n:::\n\n\n# Price Disclosure\n\n---\n\n## Example from @luco2019\n\n- Mandatory online price disclosure for retail gasoline in Chile\n- Predictions:\n  - If consumers use the information, competition will increase and prices will fall\n  - If consumers do not access the site, disclosure may facilitate tacit collusion\n  - Potential heterogeneity in use across markets, with distributional implications\n\n---\n\n## Model\n\n- @luco2019 presents a theoretical model of price competition and consumer search\n- Shows that disclosure may facilitate coordination and increase prices\n  - Depends on the rate in which firms observe deviations from the collusive price and the share of informed consumers\n\n---\n\n## Estimation\n\n- Standard TWFE estimation: $$y_{it} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} 1(\\text{Website Available})_{it} + \\gamma x_{it} + \\xi_{i} + \\eta_{t} + \\epsilon_{it}$$\n- There was a rollout of the website, so this is staggered (pre-dates the recent DD stuff on staggered DD)\n- Interact disclosure with income and search requests\n\n---\n\n## Findings\n\n- Competition decreases (prices increase) on average\n- Higher prices increases for low income and low search areas\n- Price decreases in areas with high income and high search \n\n---\n\n## Price Disclosure in Healthcare\n\n- Some small scale studies of price disclosure for specific health insurers or other contexts\n- Only large efforts are more recent through CMS price transparency initiatives\n- Data poorly formatted and difficult to use, compliance is low\n- Turquoise Health claims to have collected and organized these data (haven't used it myself)\n\n\n---\n\n## References",
