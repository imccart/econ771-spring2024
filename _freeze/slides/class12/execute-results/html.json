It's actually very hard to identify waste before-hand. [Report on End-of-life Spending](http://news.mit.edu/2018/value-late-life-health-care-spending-medicare-0628)\n\n:::\n\n\n# Physician Agency\n\n\n---\n\n## Definition\n\n- Physicians are better informed about treatment decisions than patients, and so there exists some **agency** relationship between the two. For many conditions, patients can't treat themselves even if they wanted to.\n- Physicians also face incentives other than patient welfare, such as income, reputation, organizational pressures, and career advancement\n\n---\n\n## Basic setup from @mcguire2000\n\n- Denote quantity of physician services by $x$\n- Denote benefit of services to patient by $B(x)$\n- Patients pay (and physicians receive) a price of $p$ for each unit of service $x$\n- Physicians incur cost $c$ for each unit of care\n- Net benefit to patients is $NB(x)=B(x)-px$\n- Physicians must choose quantity of care at least better than the patient's outside option, $NB(x)= B(x)-px \\geq NB^{0}$.\n\n\n---\n\n## Solving the model\n\nWith this framework, how much care will be provided? What is the optimal value of $x$?\n\n\n---\n\n## Solving the model\n\n- Patient's objective: $$\\max_{x} NB(x) = \\max_{x} B(x) - px$$\n- Physician's objective: $$\\max_{x} \\pi(x) = \\max_{x} p x - c x \\text{ s.t. } NB(x) \\geq NB^{0}$$\n- Lagrangian: $$\\mathcal{L} = p x - c x + \\lambda (B(x) - p x - NB^{0})$$\n- First order conditions:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p} & = x - \\lambda x = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} & = p - c + \\lambda B'(x) - \\lambda p = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} &= B(x) - p x - NB^{0} = 0\n\\end{align}$$\n\n\n---\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p} & = x - \\lambda x = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} & = p - c + \\lambda B'(x) - \\lambda p = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} & = B(x) - p x - NB^{0} = 0\n\\end{align}$$\n\n- From the first equation, we have $\\lambda = 1$ (seller gains all surplus...any relaxation of surplus goes to profit)\n- From the second equation, we have $B'(x)=c$ (seller will produce until marginal cost equals marginal benefit)\n- Compare to patient's optimal, $B'(x)=p$\n\n\n---\n\n## Physician agency in a graph\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](class12_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Agency with capitated payments\n\n- Physician receives fixed (\"capitated\") amount for each patient, $R$, along with some price per unit of service, $p_{s}$\n- Physician therefore paid $R + (p_{s} - c)x$ for each patient\n- Number of patients for each physician expressed as a positive function of the net benefit offered, $n(NB)$, where $NB=B(x) - p_{d}x$. Here, we assume that the insurer sets $p_{d}$ and $p_{s}$ separately (the demand and supply price, respectively).\n- Physician again aims to maximize profits, $\\pi=n(NB)\\left[R+(p_{s}-c)x\\right]$.\n\n\n---\n\n## Solution with capitated payments\n\nMaximizing the profit function yields:\n$$n'(NB)(B'(x) - p_{d}) \\left[R + (p_{s} - c)x \\right] + n(NB)(p_{s}-c) = 0$$\n\nRearranging terms and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{1}{NB}$, we get:\n$$\\frac{B'(x) - p_{d}}{NB} \\frac{R + (p_{s} - c)x}{p_{s}-c} = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{n,NB}}$$\n\n::: {.fragment}\n\n1. What happens for $R=0$?\n2. What about $R>0$, assuming $p_{s}<c$?\n\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Problems with basic model\n\n- Setup from @mcguire2000 is useful as it introduces wedge between physician and patient optimums due solely to different costs faced by the two parties\n- But it's not very flexible and it makes some strong assumptions about competition (outside options) and price setting/taking\n\n\n---\n\n## @cutler2019\n\nPhysicians aim to maximize: $$u_{ij} = \\alpha B_{S}(x_{i}) + \\beta \\pi(x_{i}) - \\delta_{d} (x_{i} - x_{i}^{D}) - \\delta_{O}(x_{i} - x_{i}^{O}),$$\n\n- $B_{S}(x_{i})$ is the perceived benefit to the patient, with utility weight $\\alpha$\n- $\\pi(x_{i})$ is the physician's profit and $\\beta$ the weight on profit in utility\n- $x_{i}$ is the quantity of care provided\n- $x^{D}$ and $x^{O}$ are preferred quantities from an informed patient and from other organizational pressures, respectively\n- $\\delta_{d}$ and $\\delta_{O}$ are functions of the deviations from these preferred quantities\n\n::: {.fragment}\nFirst order condition for $x_{i}$ yields: $$\\alpha B{'}_{S}(x_{i}) = - \\beta \\pi{'}(x_{i}) + \\delta_{d}{'} + \\delta_{O}{'}$$\n:::\n\n---\n\n$$\\alpha B{'}_{S}(x_{i}) = - \\beta \\pi{'}(x_{i}) + \\delta_{d}{'} + \\delta_{O}{'}$$\n\n- Physician sets $x_{i}$ to balance the marginal benefit to the patient with financial incentives, disutility from deviating from the patient's preferred quantities, and disutility from organizational pressures\n- 'Supplier-induced demand'\n  - $x>x^{D}$: Not really an issue as it could still be that $B(x)>B(x^{D})$\n  - More narrowly, $x>x^{D}$ and $B(x)<B(x^{D})$\n\n---\n\n## Taking this to data\n\n- Impose functional form assumptions so that: $$u_{ij} = \\alpha B(x_{i}) + \\beta \\pi x_{i} - \\frac{\\gamma_{D}}{2} (x_{i} - x_{i}^{D})^{2} - \\frac{\\gamma_{O}}{2} (x_{i} - x_{i}^{O})^{2}$$\n- Theoretical optimum: $$\\alpha B{'}(x_{i}) = \\beta \\pi  - \\gamma_{D}(x_{i} - x_{i}^{D}) - \\gamma_{O}(x_{i} - x_{i}^{O})$$\n- First-order taylor expansion of $B{'}(x_{i})$ around $\\bar{x}$ yields: $$x_{i} = \\bar{x} + Z_{i}^{D} + Z_{i}^{S} + \\varepsilon_{i},$$ so that observed treatment levels are a function of some mean value/starting point and demand and supply-side shifts\n\n\n## References",
