They propose a two-stage bargaining process:\n\n1. Hospitals and insurers negotiate over the terms of their agreement (network inclusion and prices)\n2. Individuals receive \"health draws\" which dictate their healthcare needs\n\n::: {.fragment}\n*Bargaining occurs over a base price, not specific to each procedure*\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Basic Bargaining Model\n\n- Total expected cost to the insurer, $TC_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})$ \n- Willingness to pay to have access to hospital, $W_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})$\n- Total payoff for the MCO is $$V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) = \\tau W_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) - TC_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}),$$ where $\\tau$ is the relative weight placed on employee/patient welfare\n- Net value that MCO $m$ receives from including hospital $j$ in its network is then $V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})$.\n\n---\n\n## Basic Bargaining Model\n\nIn the case of a single hospital system, and denoting hospital $j$'s marginal cost for services provided to patients in MCO $m$ is given by $mc_{mj}$, the overall profit for hospital $j$ for a given set of MCO contracts (denoted $M_{s}$), is $$\\pi_{j}\\left(M_{s},\\{\\vec{p}_{m}\\}_{m\\in M_{s}} \\right)=\\sum_{m\\in M_{s}} q_{mj}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) \\left[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} \\right].$$\n\n\n---\n\n## Basic Bargaining Model\n\nThe authors then derive the Nash bargaining solution as the choice of prices maximizing the exponentiated product of the net value from agreement:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nNB^{m,j} \\left(p_{mj} | \\vec{p}_{m,-j}\\right) &= \\left(q_{mj}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) \\left[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} \\right]\\right)^{b_{j(m)}} \\\\\n& \\times \\left(V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})\\right)^{b_{m(j)}},\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nwhere $b_{j(m)}$ is the bargaining weight of hospital $j$ when facing MCO $m$, $b_{m(j)}$ is the bargaining weight of MCO $m$ when facing hospital $j$, and $\\vec{p}_{m,-j}$ is the vector of prices for MCO $m$ and hospitals other than $j$. We can normalize bargaining weight such that $b_{j(m)} + b_{m(j)} = 1$.\n\n---\n\n## Basic Bargaining Model\n\nTaking the natural log, the resulting first order condition yields: \n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln (NB^{m,s})}{\\partial p_{mj}} =& b_{s(m)} \\frac{q_{mj} + \\frac{\\partial q_{mj}}{\\partial p_{mj}} \\left[p_{mj}-mc_{mj}\\right]}{q_{mj}\\left[p_{mj}-mc_{mj}\\right]} \\\\\n& + b_{m(j)} \\frac{\\frac{\\partial V_{m}}{\\partial p_{mj}}}{V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})} = 0\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n---\n\n## Basic Bargaining Model\n\nSimplifying and rewriting, we get: $$p_{mj} - mc_{mj} = -q_{mj} \\left(\\frac{\\partial q_{mj}}{\\partial p_{mj}} + q_{mj} \\times \\frac{b_{m(j)}}{b_{j(m)}} \\times \\frac{\\frac{\\partial V_{m}}{\\partial p_{mj}}}{\\triangle V_{m}} \\right)^{-1}$$\n\n- $\\triangle V_{m}$ is positive by construction\n- Can show that $\\frac{\\partial V_{m}}{\\partial p_{mj}}<0$ under most conditions \n\n::: {.fragment}\nBargaining tends to increase the \"effective\" price sensitivity and reduce hospital margins relative to standard pricing conditions (but not always)\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Basic Bargaining Model\n\n- Price response to other changes depends largely on $\\frac{\\partial V_{m}}{\\partial p_{mj}}$\n- Can be expressed as: $$-q_{mj}-\\alpha \\sum_{i}\\sum_{d}\\gamma_{id}c_{id}(1-c_{id}) \\left(\\sum_{k\\in N_{m}} p_{mk}s_{ikd} - p_{mj}\\right),$$ where $\\gamma_{id}$ includes several terms including disease weights and probability of disease. \n\n---\n\n## Basic Bargaining Model\n\n$$-q_{mj}-\\alpha \\sum_{i}\\sum_{d}\\gamma_{id}c_{id}(1-c_{id}) \\left(\\sum_{k\\in N_{m}} p_{mk}s_{ikd} - p_{mj}\\right),$$\n\n- $c_{id}$ denotes the coinsurance rate\n- final term is the difference between hospital $j$'s price and the weighted average price of all other hospitals (weighted by their market share)\n- $c_{id}\\times (1-c_{id})$ shows role of coinsurance in steering patients to different hospitals\n\n\n\n# Competition in Practice\n\n---\n\n## Key Issues\n\n1.

Higher prices\n2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)\n3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)\n\n::: {.fragment}\nEffects for both \"in-market\" and \"out-of-market\" mergers\n:::\n\n\n# Measuring Competition\n\n---\n\n## Importance of the market\n\n**Every** analysis of competition requires some definition of the market. This is complicated in healthcare for several reasons:\n\n1. Hospital markets more local than insurance markets\n2. Hospitals are multi-product firms\n3. Geographic market may differ by procedure\n4. Insurance networks limit choice within a geographic market\n\n---\n\n## Given a market\n\nOnce we have a measure of the market, we'd like to have a quick and easy way to assess competitiveness:\n\n1. HHI\n2. WTP\n\n\n---\n\n## HHI\n\n- Basic Cournot framework: $$\\pi_{i} = P(q) q_{i} - C_{i}(q_{i})$$\n- First order condition: $$P'(q) q_{i} + P(q) - C_{i}'(q) = 0$$\n\n---\n\n## HHI\n\n- Rewriting yields: $$\\frac{P(q) - C_{i}'(q_{i})}{P(q)} = \\frac{q_{i}}{q} \\times \\frac{-P'(q)q}{P(q)}=\\frac{\\alpha_{i}}{\\eta}$$\n- Constant marginal costs: $$\\frac{p - c_{i}}{p} = \\frac{\\alpha_{i}}{\\eta}$$\n\n---\n\n## HHI\n\n- In equilibrium, $$\\sum_{i}\\pi_{i} = \\sum_{i}(p - c_{i}) q_{i} = \\sum_{i}(p-c_{i})\\alpha_{i} q$$\n- Two equivalent expressions\n  - $\\sum_{i} \\pi_{i} = \\left(p - \\sum_{i} \\alpha_{i} c_{i} \\right)q$ and\n  - $\\sum_{i} \\pi_{i} = \\frac{pq}{\\eta} \\sum_{i} \\alpha_{i}^{2}$ after substituting $p - c_{i} = \\alpha_{i} \\frac{p}{\\eta}$.\n  \n---\n\n## HHI\n\n- Equating these two expressions yields:$$\\frac{p - \\sum_{i} \\alpha_{i} c_{i}}{q} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\alpha_{i}^{2}}{\\eta} = \\frac{HHI}{\\eta}$$\n- *Takeaway*: In linear Cournot model with constant marginal costs and homogeneous products, the markup (a common measure of market power) is proportional to the HHI. \n\n\n---\n\n## WTP\n\n- Alternative measure from Capps et al. (2003)\n- Not healthcare specific...option demand market where indermediary sells a \"network\" of products to consumers, and consumers are uncertain about final products they will need\n- **Key**: consumers agree to *ex ante* restrict their choice set before they know what services are needed\n- Derivation works backward...\n\n---\n\n\n## WTP\n\n*Step 1.* Derive *ex post* utility.\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nU_{ij} &= \\alpha R_{j} + H_{j}'\\Gamma X_{i} + \\tau_{1} T_{ij} + \\tau_{2} T_{ij} X_{i} + \\tau_{3} T_{ij} R_{j} - \\gamma(Y_{i},Z_{i}) P_{j}(Z_{i}) + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\\n &= U(H_{j},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) - \\gamma(X_{i})P_{j}(Z_{i}) + \\varepsilon_{ij},\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nwhich yields choice probabilities, $$s_{ij} = s_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) = \\frac{\\text{exp}(U(H_{j},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}))}{\\sum_{g\\in G}\\text{exp}(U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}))}.$$\n\n---\n\n## WTP\n\n*Step 2.* Derive utility from access to network, $G$, with $U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})$ taken as given.\n\nThe patient's expected maximum utility across all hospitals is, $$V(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) = \\text{E} \\left[\\max_{g\\in G} U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) + \\varepsilon_{g} \\right] = \\text{ln} \\left[\\sum_{g\\in G} \\text{exp} (U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) \\right].$$\n\n---\n\n## WTP\n\nContribution of hospital $j$ is then:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\triangle V_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) &= V(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) - V(G_{-j},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) \\\\\n &= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_{k\\in G_{-j}} \\frac{ \\text{exp} (U(H_{k},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) }{\\sum_{g\\in G} \\text{exp} (U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) }\\right)^{-1} \\right] \\\\\n &= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_{k\\in G_{-j}} s_{k}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})\\right)^{-1} \\right] \\\\\n &= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\left( 1- s_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})\\right)^{-1} \\right].\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n---\n\n## WTP\n\nTranslate into dollar values by weighting by the marginal utility of price $$\\triangle \\tilde{W}_{j} = \\frac{\\triangle V_{j}}{\\gamma (X_{i})}.$$\n\n\n---\n\n## WTP\n\n*Step 3.* Estimate *ex ante* WTP to include hospital $j$ in patient's network. (i.e., integrate over all possible health conditions)\n\n$$W_{ij}(G,Y_{i},\\lambda_{i}) = \\int_{Z} \\frac{\\delta V_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})}{\\gamma (X_{i})} f(Z_{i}|Y_{i},\\lambda_{i}) dZ_{i}.$$\n\n\nFurther integrating over all patients, $(Y_{i},\\lambda_{i})$, yields\n$$WTP_{j} = N \\int_{\\lambda} \\int_{Z} \\int_{Y} \\frac{1}{\\gamma (X_{i})} \\text{ln}\\left[\\frac{1}{1-s_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})} \\right]f(Y_{i},Z_{i},\\lambda_{i})dY_{i} dZ_{i} d\\lambda_{i}.$$\n\n---\n\n## WTP in Practice\n\nSimplify by calculating WTP for each \"micro-market\" (e.g., health condition) and taking sum:\n\n$$WTP_{j} = - \\sum_{m} N_{m} \\text{ln}(1 - s_{mj})$$\n",
