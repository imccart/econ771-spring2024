title: "Background on Waste and Fraud"
---

Module 6, the last of the class!, covers waste and fraud in healthcare. We'll start this module with a general discussion of waste and its sources, based on @shrank2019. We'll discuss sources of waste more directly next class, and focus specifically on fraud and overuse in the last two classes of this module.
