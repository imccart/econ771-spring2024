title: "Pricing and Competition: What we know"
---

The goal for today's class is to understand the literature on pricing and competition. We'll focus our discussion on three groups of papers.

### @kessler2000 and @miller2022
These papers consider the impact of competition on prices in the context of "structure-conduct-performace" type studies. Such studies often consider a summary measure of market structure (like HHI) and then estimate a relationship between that measure and prices. The literature has since moved beyond these types of studies, as discussed in @miller2022, but we need to know this literature exists before we move on.

###
These papers directly measure the effects of mergers or closures.

### 
These papers collectively develop structural models of bargaining that have become the standard in the literature at this point.
