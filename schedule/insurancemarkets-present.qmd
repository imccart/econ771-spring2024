title: "Insurance Markets: What we're learning"
---

The more recent literature in health insurance markets continues to consider the role of adverse selection, as well as the role of competition in other dimensions of health insurance products (like network construction), and the feasibility of "managed competition".For this class, we'll focus on the following papers:

### @kong2023
This paper looks at adverse selection as a source of natural monopoly in insurance markets, adding a new layer to the understanding of adverse selection in insurance markets. The paper challenges conventional views on market competition and monopoly in the context of insurance, offering a novel perspective that complements and extends the literature developed by @handel2013, @handel2015, and @handel2019, among otherse. 

### @shepard2022
This paper considers the interplay between hospital network competition and adverse selection, focusing on the Massachusetts health insurance exchange. The authors advance the literature on health insurance markets by introducing the concept of hospital network competition into the discussion of adverse selection. Traditionally, studies have focused on premiums, plan benefits, and individual consumer attributes in analyzing adverse selection. This paper broadens this perspective by showing that the networks of hospitals associated with insurance plans are also crucial in shaping consumer behavior and the overall dynamics of adverse selection in the market. This novel approach enriches the understanding of the multifaceted nature of health insurance markets and highlights the importance of considering a broader range of factors in studying these markets.

### @cabral2018 and @curto2021
These papers advance our understanding of managed competition. @cabral2018 cautions against the assumption that increased subsidies will directly benefit consumers, emphasizing the need for careful design and regulation of subsidy mechanisms, and @curto2021 examines the potential for competition to improve consumer outcomes in these markets. Both papers underscore the importance of balancing market forces with effective regulation to achieve the goals of managed competition in government-sponsored health insurance programs.
