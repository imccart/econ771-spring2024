title: "Variation and Physician Agency: What we know"
---

The goal for today's class is to understand the literature on geographic variation in healthcare spending/utilization and the role of physician agency. As before, we'll focus our discussion on three groups of papers.

### @finkelstein2016 and @hull2023
These papers attempt to decompose variation in healthcare spending between demand and supply-side factors.

### @clemens2014
This paper examines physician responses to financial incentives.

### @afendulis2007 and @iizuka2012
These papers examine the role of physician agency in treatment decisions, @afendulis2007 in the context of surgical intervention among cardiologists and @iizuka2012 in the context of prescription drug decisions.
