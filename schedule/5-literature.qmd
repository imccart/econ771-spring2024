title: "Physician Learning"

Module 5 covers physician learning. I've attempted to split this area into three general topics, one that considers learning in a more myopic setting, another that considers learning with experimentation, and another area that considers learning by doing or skill accumulation. A broad list of relevant papers is in the drop-down list below.
